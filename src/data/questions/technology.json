Your device receives these signals and converts them back to data. It all happens incredibly fast. Walls and distance weaken the signal, which is why WiFi works better when you're closer to the router!",

The 2.4GHz frequency penetrates walls better but has shorter theoretical range than 5GHz, which is faster but more easily blocked. This is why you get better WiFi closer to the router!",

The three large corner squares help cameras orient the code correctly. The pattern can store thousands of characters - much more than traditional barcodes.

Think of frequency like a highway - higher frequencies are like wider highways that can carry more data at once. These millimeter waves can transmit much more information simultaneously.
