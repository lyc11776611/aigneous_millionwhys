The 2.4GHz frequency penetrates walls better but has shorter theoretical range than 5GHz, which is faster but more easily blocked. This is why you get better WiFi closer to the router!",

The three large corner squares help cameras orient the code correctly. The pattern can store thousands of characters - much more than traditional barcodes. Your camera captures the image, software decodes the pattern, and extracts the data (like URLs or text). QR codes also include error correction, so they work even if partially damaged!",

Think of frequency like a highway - higher frequencies are like wider highways that can carry more data at once. These millimeter waves can transmit much more information simultaneously.
