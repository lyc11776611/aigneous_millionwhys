        "Correct! WiFi uses radio waves that naturally spread out and weaken as they travel through space - following the inverse square law. Walls, furniture, and other obstacles absorb and reflect these waves, reducing signal strength. The 2.4GHz frequency penetrates walls better but has shorter theoretical range than 5GHz, which is faster but more easily blocked. This is why you get better WiFi closer to the router!",

        "Wrong. 5G doesn't work faster because of stronger signal power. In fact, higher frequency 5G signals are weaker and travel shorter distances than 4G signals.",
        "Wrong. While 5G networks may eventually have more towers, speed doesn't come from tower quantity. The speed advantage comes from using higher radio frequencies that can carry more data simultaneously.",
        "Correct! 5G uses higher radio frequencies (24-100 GHz) compared to 4G (under 6 GHz). Think of frequency like a highway - higher frequencies are like wider highways that can carry more data at once. These millimeter waves can transmit much more information simultaneously. The tradeoff is they travel shorter distances and are blocked by walls more easily, which is why 5G needs more small cells. This is why 5G can be 10-100 times faster than 4G!",
        "Wrong. 5G and 4G use similar data compression techniques. The speed advantage comes from 5G using higher radio frequencies that can carry more data simultaneously, not better compression."

        "错误。5G不是因为更强的信号功率而更快。事实上，更高频率的5G信号比4G信号更弱且传播距离更短。",
        "错误。虽然5G网络最终可能有更多信号塔，但速度不来自信号塔数量。速度优势来自使用能同时传输更多数据的更高无线电频率。",
        "正确！5G使用比4G（低于6GHz）更高的无线电频率（24-100GHz）。把频率想象成高速公路——更高频率就像更宽的高速公路可以同时承载更多数据。这些毫米波可以同时传输更多信息。代价是它们传播距离更短且更容易被墙壁阻挡，这就是为什么5G需要更多小基站。这就是为什么5G可以比4G快10-100倍！",
        "错误。5G和4G使用类似的数据压缩技术。速度优势来自5G使用能同时传输更多数据的更高无线电频率，而非更好的压缩。"

        "Correct! Electric cars use large battery packs (usually lithium-ion) to store electrical energy. Instead of an internal combustion engine that burns gasoline, they have electric motors that convert electrical energy directly into mechanical motion. You charge the battery by plugging it in, just like charging a phone but much larger! Electric motors are also more efficient than gas engines - they convert about 85-90% of energy to motion versus only 20-30% for gas engines. No gasoline, oil changes, or exhaust emissions needed!",
        "Wrong. Electric cars don't run only on solar power - they charge from the electrical grid. Some have solar panels for auxiliary power, but the main power comes from rechargeable batteries charged via plugging in.",
        "Wrong. While electric cars capture some energy through regenerative braking, they can't generate enough power to drive indefinitely. They primarily rely on battery power that must be recharged by plugging in.",
