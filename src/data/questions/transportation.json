      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. Trains don't steer because they don't need to—tracks handle direction. But that's not why tracks exist.",
        "Correct! Steel wheels on steel rails create very low friction, allowing trains to pull huge loads efficiently. A train can move 100 tons with the same energy a truck uses for 1 ton! Tracks also guide direction.",
        "Wrong. While tracks do prevent derailing, the main benefit is the extremely low friction of steel on steel.",
        "Wrong. Roads can support heavy vehicles. Tracks exist for efficiency—steel on steel friction is far lower than rubber on asphalt."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "不对。火车不需要转向，因为铁轨已经决定了方向，但这并非铁轨存在的根本原因。",
        "正确！钢轮在钢轨上产生的摩擦力极小，使得火车能高效牵引巨大负载。火车用与卡车运送1吨货物相同的能量，就能拉动100吨！轨道还起到导向作用。",
        "错误。虽然轨道确实能防止脱轨，但主要好处在于钢与钢之间的极低摩擦力。",
        "错误。道路能够承载重型车辆。铁轨的存在是为了效率——钢与钢之间的摩擦力远低于橡胶与沥青之间的摩擦力。"

      "explanations_en": [
        "Correct! The pointed bow (front) parts water smoothly, reducing drag. A flat front would push water and create resistance. The shape lets ships move faster with less fuel. Different bow shapes suit different speeds and conditions!",
        "Wrong. Shape doesn't affect buoyancy—that depends on displacement. The point reduces water resistance.",
        "Wrong. Anchors could be stored anywhere. The pointed shape is purely for hydrodynamics.",
        "Wrong. Ship navigation doesn't depend on bow shape. The point is designed to minimize water resistance."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "正确！尖形船首（前端）能顺畅地划开水面，减少阻力。平坦的前端则会推水产生阻力。这种形状让船只以更少的燃料行驶得更快。不同的船首形状适用于不同的速度和条件！",
        "错误。形状不影响浮力——浮力取决于排水量。尖头设计是为了减少水的阻力。",
        "错误。锚可以存放在任何地方，其尖端形状纯粹是为了流体动力学设计的。",
        "错误。船舶航行并不依赖船首形状。其尖端设计旨在最小化水的阻力。"

        "Wrong. Gyroscopic effect helps but isn't the main factor. Bikes can balance even with non-spinning wheels in tests.",
        "Wrong. Bikes aren't in perfect balance. They constantly make small corrections to stay upright.",
        "Correct! Bicycle stability comes from: steering geometry (caster effect), gyroscopic forces, and rider corrections. The front wheel's angle makes the bike self-steer into falls. Even scientists debated this for over a century!",

        "不对。自行车并非处于完美平衡状态，它们需要不断进行微调以保持直立。",
        "正确！自行车的稳定性源于：转向几何（后倾效应）、陀螺效应以及骑手的调整。前轮的角度使自行车能够自动转向以抵消倾倒。科学家们对此争论了超过一个世纪！",

        "Wrong. On dry roads, smooth tires (like racing slicks) actually grip better. Grooves sacrifice some dry grip for wet safety.",
        "Correct! Grooves channel water away from under the tire, preventing hydroplaning. On wet roads, water can lift the tire and cause loss of control. The patterns are designed to push water out quickly!",
        "Wrong. Grooves don't significantly reduce weight. Their purpose is water evacuation for wet-road safety.",

        "错误。在干燥路面上，光滑轮胎（如赛车光头胎）实际上抓地力更强。沟槽设计牺牲了部分干地抓地力以提升湿地安全性。",
        "正确！轮胎的沟槽能将水从胎面下方引导出去，防止水滑现象发生。在湿滑路面上，积水可能使轮胎浮起导致失控。这些花纹的设计正是为了快速排水！",
        "错误。凹槽并不会显著减轻重量，其作用在于排水以保障湿滑路面的安全。",

        "Correct! Submarines have special tanks that fill with water to sink (heavier than surrounding water) or fill with air to rise (lighter). This changes buoyancy without changing the submarine's shape or size!",
        "Wrong. Propellers provide forward thrust. Depth is controlled by buoyancy through ballast tanks.",
        "Wrong. Submarine hulls are rigid and don't change shape. Buoyancy is controlled by ballast tanks.",

        "Wrong. Rotor position isn't about structural strength. It's about creating lift above the aircraft.",
        "Correct! Helicopter rotor blades are shaped like airplane wings. As they spin, they create lift by pushing air down. Tilting the rotor lets helicopters move in any direction—they're like flying fans that can change angle!",

        "正确！直升机旋翼叶片的形状类似飞机机翼。当它们旋转时，通过向下推动空气产生升力。倾斜旋翼使直升机能够朝任意方向移动——它们就像能改变角度的飞行风扇！",
