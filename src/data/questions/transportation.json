      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. Trains don't steer because they don't need to—tracks handle direction. But that's not why tracks exist.",
        "Correct! Steel wheels on steel rails create very low friction, allowing trains to pull huge loads efficiently. A train can move 100 tons with the same energy a truck uses for 1 ton! Tracks also guide direction.",
        "Wrong. While tracks do prevent derailing, the main benefit is the extremely low friction of steel on steel.",
        "Wrong. Roads can support heavy vehicles. Tracks exist for efficiency—steel on steel friction is far lower than rubber on asphalt."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "错啦！火车不转向是因为铁轨引导方向，但这并非铁轨存在的根本原因。",
        "对啦！钢铁轮子在钢轨上摩擦极小，让火车能高效拉动巨量货物——用卡车运1吨货的力气，火车能运100吨！铁轨还负责引导方向。",
        "错啦！铁轨确实防止脱轨，但主要好处是钢铁间的极低摩擦带来的高效率。",
        "错啦！公路能承受重型车辆。铁轨是为效率而生——钢铁摩擦远低于橡胶与沥青。"

      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanations_en": [
        "Correct! The pointed bow (front) parts water smoothly, reducing drag. A flat front would push water and create resistance. The shape lets ships move faster with less fuel. Different bow shapes suit different speeds and conditions!",
        "Wrong. Shape doesn't affect buoyancy—that depends on displacement. The point reduces water resistance.",
        "Wrong. Anchors could be stored anywhere. The pointed shape is purely for hydrodynamics.",
        "Wrong. Ship navigation doesn't depend on bow shape. The point is designed to minimize water resistance."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "正确！尖尖的船头能平滑地分开水流，减少阻力。如果船头是平的，会推开水流产生更大阻力。这种设计让船跑得更快，还省燃料。不同船头形状适合不同速度和条件哦！",
        "不对。形状不影响浮力，浮力取决于排水量。尖头主要是为了减少水的阻力。",
        "不对。锚链可以存放在任何地方。尖头设计纯粹是为了流体动力学。",
        "不对。船的导航不依赖船头形状。尖头是为了最小化水的阻力。"

      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. Gyroscopic effect helps but isn't the main factor. Bikes can balance even with non-spinning wheels in tests.",
        "Wrong. Bikes aren't in perfect balance. They constantly make small corrections to stay upright.",
        "Correct! Bicycle stability comes from: steering geometry (caster effect), gyroscopic forces, and rider corrections. The front wheel's angle makes the bike self-steer into falls. Even scientists debated this for over a century!",
        "Wrong. Riders do help, but bikes can balance without riders at certain speeds. Multiple physics effects work together."

        "答对啦！自行车稳定靠三大法宝：前叉转向角（像购物车轮的自回正）、陀螺效应，还有骑手的微调。前轮角度能让车自动转向防倒——科学家为这事儿争论了上百年呢！",
        "不准确。骑手确实能帮忙，但特定速度下无人自行车也能自平衡。关键是多种物理效应在协同作战！"

      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. On dry roads, smooth tires (like racing slicks) actually grip better. Grooves sacrifice some dry grip for wet safety.",
        "Correct! Grooves channel water away from under the tire, preventing hydroplaning. On wet roads, water can lift the tire and cause loss of control. The patterns are designed to push water out quickly!",
        "Wrong. Grooves don't significantly reduce weight. Their purpose is water evacuation for wet-road safety.",

        "错误。在干燥路面上，光滑轮胎（如赛车光头胎）抓地力其实更好。花纹牺牲了部分干地抓地力来保障湿滑路面的安全。",
        "正确！花纹能将轮胎下方的水排走，防止水滑现象。在湿滑路面上，积水可能抬起轮胎导致失控。这些图案设计就是为了快速排水！",
        "错误。花纹并不会显著减轻重量。它们的主要作用是在湿滑路面上排水以保障安全。",

        "Correct! Submarines have special tanks that fill with water to sink (heavier than surrounding water) or fill with air to rise (lighter). This changes buoyancy without changing the submarine's shape or size!",
        "Wrong. Propellers provide forward thrust. Depth is controlled by buoyancy through ballast tanks.",
        "Wrong. Submarine hulls are rigid and don't change shape. Buoyancy is controlled by ballast tanks.",

        "Wrong. While rotors do push air down, that's the result not the purpose. The rotor creates lift through aerodynamics.",
        "Wrong. Rotor position isn't about structural strength. It's about creating lift above the aircraft.",
        "Correct! Helicopter rotor blades are shaped like airplane wings. As they spin, they create lift by pushing air down. Tilting the rotor lets helicopters move in any direction—they're like flying fans that can change angle!",

        "正确！直升机旋翼叶片形状像飞机机翼。旋转时，它们通过向下推空气产生升力。倾斜旋翼让直升机能向任何方向移动——就像能改变角度的飞行风扇！",
