        "Wrong. While ice can trap some air bubbles, this isn't why it floats. Pure ice without bubbles still floats because its molecular structure makes it less dense than water.",
        "Correct! Ice is less dense than liquid water, which is unusual. When water freezes, molecules arrange in a crystal structure with more space between them. This makes ice about 9% less dense than water. So ice floats! This property is crucial for aquatic life, as frozen lakes stay liquid underneath.",
        "Wrong. Surface tension can hold very light objects on water, but ice floats due to its lower density, not surface tension. Even large icebergs float.",
        "Wrong. Temperature doesn't create an upward force. Ice floats because when water freezes into a crystal structure, it becomes less dense than liquid water."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "不对。虽然冰会困住一些气泡，但这并非其漂浮的原因。即使没有气泡的纯冰也会漂浮，因为其分子结构使其密度低于水。",
        "正确！冰的密度比液态水小，这很不寻常。当水结冰时，分子会排列成晶体结构，彼此间留有更多空间，使得冰的密度比水低约9%。因此冰能漂浮！这一特性对水生生物至关重要，因为冰冻的湖泊下方仍保持液态。",
        "错误。表面张力可以支撑很轻的物体浮在水面上，但冰浮起来是因为其密度较低，而非表面张力。即便是巨大的冰山也能漂浮。",
        "不对。温度并不会产生向上的力。冰能浮起来是因为水结成晶体结构时，其密度比液态水小。"

        "Correct! Microwaves are electromagnetic waves that make water molecules vibrate rapidly. Food contains lots of water. When water molecules spin back and forth billions of times per second, this friction creates heat. That's why foods with more water heat faster, and why empty plates stay cool!",
        "Wrong. Microwaves don't cause chemical reactions in food. They simply make water molecules vibrate, creating heat through friction. Cooking may cause chemical changes, but that's from the heat, not the microwaves directly.",
        "Wrong. Microwaves don't work by compressing air. They penetrate food and directly cause water molecules inside to vibrate and generate heat.",

      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. While air pressure in the ball helps maintain its shape, bouncing happens because the ball's material compresses and releases elastic energy, not just from air pressure.",
        "Correct! When a ball hits the ground, it compresses and stores elastic energy, like a spring. This stored energy pushes the ball back to its original shape, launching it upward. Some energy is lost as heat and sound, so each bounce is lower. Materials like rubber store more energy and bounce better!",
        "Wrong. The ground doesn't repel the ball. The bounce comes from elastic energy stored when the ball compresses on impact, then releases as it returns to its original shape.",
        "Wrong. Gravity never reverses - it always pulls downward. The ball bounces up due to elastic energy released when the compressed ball springs back to its original shape."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。虽然球内气压有助于维持其形状，但球的弹跳是因为其材料压缩并释放弹性势能，而不仅仅是由于气压的作用。",
        "正确！当球撞击地面时，它会像弹簧一样压缩并储存弹性势能。这种储存的能量推动球恢复原状，使其向上弹起。部分能量会以热和声的形式散失，因此每次弹跳高度都会降低。像橡胶这样的材料能储存更多能量，弹跳效果更好！",
        "不对。地面并不会排斥球。球的弹跳来源于撞击时球体压缩所储存的弹性势能，随后在恢复原状时释放出来。",
        "错误。重力从不反向——它总是向下拉。球之所以弹起，是因为当被压缩的球恢复原状时释放出的弹性势能。"

        "Wrong. Mirrors don't flip light horizontally. They reflect light straight back at the same angle. The apparent left-right reversal is actually a front-to-back flip.",
        "Wrong. While your brain does interpret the reflection, mirrors actually reverse front to back, not left to right. You perceive it as left-right because you imagine yourself turned around.",
        "Correct! Mirrors don't reverse left-right - they reverse front to back! When you face a mirror, your front becomes the mirror's back. If you raise your right hand, the person in the mirror also raises their right hand (from their perspective). We think it's reversed because we imagine turning around to face the same direction as our reflection.",

        "不对。镜子并不会水平翻转光线，而是以相同角度将光线直接反射回去。看似左右颠倒的现象实际上是前后翻转。",
        "不对。虽然你的大脑确实在解读镜像，但实际上镜子是前后翻转，而非左右颠倒。你之所以感觉是左右颠倒，是因为你想象自己转了个身。",
        "正确！镜子并不会左右颠倒——它们是前后翻转！当你面对镜子时，你的前方变成了镜中的后方。如果你举起右手，镜中的人也会举起他们的右手（从他们的视角看）。我们之所以认为它颠倒了，是因为我们想象自己转身与镜中映像面向同一方向。",
        "错误。在平面镜中，玻璃不会使光线侧向弯曲。镜子以相等角度反射光线。这种反转是前后方向的，而非左右或由弯曲引起。"

When molecules are closer, they transfer vibrations faster. Sound travels at 343 m/s in air but 1,480 m/s in water - over 4 times faster!",
        "Wrong. Water doesn't amplify sound waves. Sound travels faster in water because molecules are closer together, allowing vibrations to transfer more quickly from one molecule to the next.",

Like glass in hot water, the ice can't handle the uneven expansion and cracks! The warmer the water, the louder the crack.",
