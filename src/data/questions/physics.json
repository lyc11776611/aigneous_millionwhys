      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. While ice can trap some air bubbles, this isn't why it floats. Pure ice without bubbles still floats because its molecular structure makes it less dense than water.",
        "Correct! Ice is less dense than liquid water, which is unusual. When water freezes, molecules arrange in a crystal structure with more space between them. This makes ice about 9% less dense than water. So ice floats! This property is crucial for aquatic life, as frozen lakes stay liquid underneath.",
        "Wrong. Surface tension can hold very light objects on water, but ice floats due to its lower density, not surface tension. Even large icebergs float.",
        "Wrong. Temperature doesn't create an upward force. Ice floats because when water freezes into a crystal structure, it becomes less dense than liquid water."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错啦！冰块里确实可能有气泡，但这可不是它浮起来的原因。就算没有气泡的纯冰块也能浮起来，因为它的分子结构让它比水轻。",
        "对啦！冰的密度比液态水小，这可不常见哦。水结冰时，分子会排成晶体结构，中间空隙变大，让冰的密度比水小约9%。所以冰就浮起来啦！这个特性对水生生物很重要，因为湖面结冰后下面还是液态水。",
        "不对哦。表面张力能托住很轻的东西，但冰块浮起来是因为密度更小，不是表面张力。就连大冰山也能浮着呢！",
        "错啦！温度可不会产生向上的推力。冰块能浮起来，是因为水结冰变成晶体结构后，密度比液态水小。"

        "Correct! Microwaves are electromagnetic waves that make water molecules vibrate rapidly. Food contains lots of water. When water molecules spin back and forth billions of times per second, this friction creates heat. That's why foods with more water heat faster, and why empty plates stay cool!",
        "Wrong. Microwaves don't cause chemical reactions in food. They simply make water molecules vibrate, creating heat through friction. Cooking may cause chemical changes, but that's from the heat, not the microwaves directly.",
        "Wrong. Microwaves don't work by compressing air. They penetrate food and directly cause water molecules inside to vibrate and generate heat.",

      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. While air pressure in the ball helps maintain its shape, bouncing happens because the ball's material compresses and releases elastic energy, not just from air pressure.",
        "Correct! When a ball hits the ground, it compresses and stores elastic energy, like a spring. This stored energy pushes the ball back to its original shape, launching it upward. Some energy is lost as heat and sound, so each bounce is lower. Materials like rubber store more energy and bounce better!",
        "Wrong. The ground doesn't repel the ball. The bounce comes from elastic energy stored when the ball compresses on impact, then releases as it returns to its original shape.",
        "Wrong. Gravity never reverses - it always pulls downward. The ball bounces up due to elastic energy released when the compressed ball springs back to its original shape."

        "错误。虽然球内气压帮助维持形状，但弹跳是因球体材料压缩释放弹性势能，不只是气压作用。",
        "正确！球落地时压缩储存弹性势能，像弹簧一样。储存的能量让球恢复原状并弹起，部分能量以热和声形式流失，所以每次弹跳变低。橡胶等材料储能更多，弹得更高！",
        "错误。地面不会排斥球，弹跳来自球撞击压缩时储存的弹性势能，在恢复形状时释放。",

        "Wrong. Mirrors don't flip light horizontally. They reflect light straight back at the same angle. The apparent left-right reversal is actually a front-to-back flip.",
        "Wrong. While your brain does interpret the reflection, mirrors actually reverse front to back, not left to right. You perceive it as left-right because you imagine yourself turned around.",
        "Correct! Mirrors don't reverse left-right - they reverse front to back! When you face a mirror, your front becomes the mirror's back. If you raise your right hand, the person in the mirror also raises their right hand (from their perspective). We think it's reversed because we imagine turning around to face the same direction as our reflection.",

        "正确！镜子不会左右颠倒——它们会前后翻转！当你面对镜子时，你的前面变成了镜子的后面。如果你举起右手，镜中人也会举起他们的右手（从他们的视角）。我们觉得颠倒是因为想象转身和反射面朝同一方向。",
        "错误。平面镜中玻璃不会侧向弯曲光线。镜子以相等角度反射光线。颠倒现象是前后翻转造成的，与左右颠倒或光线弯曲无关。"

When molecules are closer, they transfer vibrations faster. Sound travels at 343 m/s in air but 1,480 m/s in water - over 4 times faster!",
        "Wrong. Water doesn't amplify sound waves. Sound travels faster in water because molecules are closer together, allowing vibrations to transfer more quickly from one molecule to the next.",

        "错误。水不会放大声波。声音在水中更快是因分子更紧密，让振动能更快在分子间传递。",

        "Correct! This is called thermal shock. The outside of the ice cube heats and expands quickly while the inside stays cold and contracted. This creates stress between the layers. Like glass in hot water, the ice can't handle the uneven expansion and cracks! The warmer the water, the louder the crack.",
        "Wrong. Water doesn't dissolve ice by breaking it apart. Ice cracks due to thermal shock - the outside expands from heat while the inside stays cold, creating internal stress.",

        "Correct! This is Archimedes' principle! A ship's hollow shape lets it displace a huge volume of water. If the water displaced weighs more than the ship, it floats. A stone is solid and compact - it can't displace enough water to equal its weight, so it sinks. That's why a steel ship floats but a steel ball sinks!",
