        "Wrong. While ice can trap some air bubbles, this isn't why it floats. Pure ice without bubbles still floats because its molecular structure makes it less dense than water.",
        "Correct! Ice is less dense than liquid water, which is unusual. When water freezes, molecules arrange in a crystal structure with more space between them. This makes ice about 9% less dense than water. So ice floats! This property is crucial for aquatic life, as frozen lakes stay liquid underneath.",
        "Wrong. Surface tension can hold very light objects on water, but ice floats due to its lower density, not surface tension. Even large icebergs float.",
        "Wrong. Temperature doesn't create an upward force. Ice floats because when water freezes into a crystal structure, it becomes less dense than liquid water."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。虽然冰可以困住一些气泡，但这不是它漂浮的原因。没有气泡的纯冰仍然会浮起，因为其分子结构使它比水的密度小。",
        "正确！冰的密度比液态水小，这很不寻常。当水结冰时，分子排列成晶体结构，彼此间隔更大。这使冰的密度比水低约9%。所以冰会浮起来！这一特性对水生生物至关重要，因为结冰的湖泊底部保持液态。",
        "错误。表面张力可以托住非常轻的物体，但冰漂浮是由于其密度较低，而非表面张力。即使是大型冰山也会漂浮。",
        "错误。温度不会产生向上的力。冰漂浮是因为水冻结成晶体结构时，密度变得比液态水小。"

        "Correct! Microwaves are electromagnetic waves that make water molecules vibrate rapidly. Food contains lots of water. When water molecules spin back and forth billions of times per second, this friction creates heat. That's why foods with more water heat faster, and why empty plates stay cool!",

      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. While air pressure in the ball helps maintain its shape, bouncing happens because the ball's material compresses and releases elastic energy, not just from air pressure.",
        "Correct! When a ball hits the ground, it compresses and stores elastic energy, like a spring. This stored energy pushes the ball back to its original shape, launching it upward. Some energy is lost as heat and sound, so each bounce is lower. Materials like rubber store more energy and bounce better!",
        "Wrong. The ground doesn't repel the ball. The bounce comes from elastic energy stored when the ball compresses on impact, then releases as it returns to its original shape.",

        "错误。虽然球内气压有助于保持其形状，但弹跳是因为球的材料压缩并释放弹性能量，而不仅仅是气压作用。",
        "正确！球撞击地面时会被压缩并储存弹性能量，就像弹簧一样。这种储存的能量推动球恢复原形，使其向上弹起。部分能量以热量和声音形式损失，所以每次弹跳都更低。橡胶等材料储能更多，弹性更好！",
        "错误。地面不会排斥球。弹跳来自球在撞击时压缩储存的弹性能量，然后在恢复原形时释放。",

        "Wrong. Mirrors don't flip light horizontally. They reflect light straight back at the same angle. The apparent left-right reversal is actually a front-to-back flip.",
        "Wrong. While your brain does interpret the reflection, mirrors actually reverse front to back, not left to right. You perceive it as left-right because you imagine yourself turned around.",
        "Correct! Mirrors don't reverse left-right - they reverse front to back! When you face a mirror, your front becomes the mirror's back. If you raise your right hand, the person in the mirror also raises their right hand (from their perspective). We think it's reversed because we imagine turning around to face the same direction as our reflection.",

        "正确！镜子不是左右颠倒——而是前后颠倒！当你面对镜子时，你的前面变成了镜子的后面。如果你举起右手，镜中的人从他们的角度看也举起了右手。我们认为是颠倒的，是因为想象自己转身与镜像面向同一方向。",

When molecules are closer, they transfer vibrations faster. Sound travels at 343 m/s in air but 1,480 m/s in water - over 4 times faster!",
        "Wrong. Water doesn't amplify sound waves. Sound travels faster in water because molecules are closer together, allowing vibrations to transfer more quickly from one molecule to the next.",

        "Correct! This is called thermal shock. The outside of the ice cube heats and expands quickly while the inside stays cold and contracted. This creates stress between the layers. Like glass in hot water, the ice can't handle the uneven expansion and cracks! The warmer the water, the louder the crack.",
        "Wrong. Water doesn't dissolve ice by breaking it apart. Ice cracks due to thermal shock - the outside expands from heat while the inside stays cold, creating internal stress.",

        "Correct! When air heats, molecules move faster and spread apart, taking up more space. This makes hot air less dense than cold air.

This convection creates wind, makes hot air balloons fly, and circulates heat in your home!",
