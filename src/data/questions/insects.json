        "Correct! Ants release pheromones that other ants follow. When one finds food, it leaves a chemical trail back to the nest. More ants follow and strengthen the trail, creating those neat lines!",

        "Correct! Many predators are triggered by movement and ignore motionless prey. Playing dead (thanatosis) can save an insect's life. Some even release bad-smelling chemicals to seem more convincingly dead!",
        "Wrong. Playing dead isn't restful—it's a stress response. Insects have other ways to conserve energy that don't involve this defense mechanism.",
        "Wrong. This behavior is conscious defense, not sleep. Insects can snap out of it instantly when danger passes.",
        "Wrong. Playing dead doesn't affect body temperature. It's purely a predator-avoidance strategy."

        "没错！许多捕食者会被移动触发而对静止的猎物视而不见。装死（假死状态）能救昆虫一命。有些昆虫甚至会释放难闻的化学物质，让自己看起来更像真的死了！",
        "错误。装死并非休息，而是一种应激反应。昆虫有其他节省能量的方式，无需采用这种防御机制。",
        "错误。这种行为是有意识的防御，而非睡眠。昆虫在危险过去后能立即恢复。",
        "不对。装死并不会影响体温，这纯粹是一种躲避捕食者的策略。"
