        "Correct! Ants release pheromones that other ants follow. When one finds food, it leaves a chemical trail back to the nest. More ants follow and strengthen the trail, creating those neat lines!",

        "Correct! Many predators are triggered by movement and ignore motionless prey. Playing dead (thanatosis) can save an insect's life. Some even release bad-smelling chemicals to seem more convincingly dead!",
        "Wrong. Playing dead isn't restful—it's a stress response. Insects have other ways to conserve energy that don't involve this defense mechanism.",
        "Wrong. This behavior is conscious defense, not sleep. Insects can snap out of it instantly when danger passes.",
        "Wrong. Playing dead doesn't affect body temperature. It's purely a predator-avoidance strategy."

        "正确！许多捕食者会被运动触发，忽略静止的猎物。装死（假死行为）能救昆虫一命。有些昆虫还会释放难闻的化学物质，让装死更逼真！",
        "错误。装死可不是休息，而是一种应激反应。昆虫有其他方式节省能量，不需要这种防御机制。",
        "错误。这种行为是主动防御，不是睡觉。危险一过，昆虫能立刻恢复活动。",
        "错误。装死不影响体温，纯粹是躲避捕食者的策略。"
