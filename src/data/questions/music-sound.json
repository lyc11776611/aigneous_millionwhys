        "Wrong. Temperature affects pitch slightly but doesn't explain why a piano sounds different from a violin playing the same note.",
        "Correct! Each instrument produces a unique mix of overtones (harmonics) along with the main note. A violin and piano playing the same note have different overtone patterns—that's their timbre or 'color' of sound!",
        "Wrong. Sound travels at the same speed regardless of instrument. The difference is in the sound wave patterns produced.",
        "Wrong. Our ears hear all instruments similarly. The difference is in the actual sound waves each instrument produces."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。温度确实会轻微影响音高，但这并不能解释为什么钢琴和小提琴演奏同一音符时声音不同。",
        "正确！每种乐器在发出主音的同时，都会产生独特的泛音（谐波）组合。小提琴和钢琴演奏同一音符时，其泛音结构各不相同——这正是它们音色或声音“色彩”的差异所在！",
        "错误。声音的传播速度与乐器无关，差异在于产生的声波模式不同。",
        "不对。我们的耳朵对所有乐器的听觉方式是一样的，区别在于每种乐器实际产生的声音波不同。"

      "explanations_en": [
        "Correct! Sound waves reflect off hard surfaces like walls, cliffs, or buildings. The reflected sound reaches your ears after the original, creating an echo. Soft surfaces absorb sound, which is why echoes are clearer in empty rooms!",
        "Wrong. Air doesn't carry sound twice. The echo is a reflection of the original sound wave bouncing back.",
        "Wrong. Ears don't have replay function. You hear actual reflected sound waves arriving after the original.",
        "Wrong. Sound waves don't split to create echoes. They bounce off surfaces intact."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "正确！声波会在墙壁、悬崖或建筑物等坚硬表面反射。反射的声音比原声稍晚到达你的耳朵，从而形成回声。而柔软的表面会吸收声音，这就是为什么在空房间里回声更清晰！",
        "不对。空气不会传播两次声音。回声是原始声波反射回来的结果。",
        "不对。耳朵没有回放功能。你听到的是实际反射回来的声波，它们比原声晚到。",
        "不对。声波不会分裂产生回声，它们是完整地从表面反射回来的。"

        "Wrong. High-quality recordings preserve sound accurately. The strange feeling comes from hearing your voice externally.",
        "Correct! You normally hear your voice through skull vibrations AND air. Recordings only capture the air portion. Without bone conduction, your voice sounds higher and thinner—that's the real external sound of your voice!",

        "没错！你通常通过颅骨振动和空气传导听到自己的声音。录音只捕捉到空气传导部分。没有骨传导，你的声音听起来更高更细——这才是你声音在外部真实的样子！",

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. Sound travels through solid walls, not through holes. Even sealed walls transmit some sound.",
        "Correct! Sound waves make wall molecules vibrate, passing energy through the solid material. The wall then vibrates air on the other side. Low frequencies travel through walls better than high ones—that's why you hear bass from neighbors!",
        "Wrong. While air gaps help sound travel, sound also moves directly through solid materials by vibration.",
        "Wrong. Walls actually reduce sound, they don't amplify it. Some sound still gets through via vibration."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。声音是通过固体墙壁传播的，而不是通过孔洞。即使是密封的墙壁也会传递一些声音。",
        "没错！声波使墙壁分子振动，将能量传递过固体材料。墙壁随之振动另一侧的空气。低频声波比高频更容易穿透墙壁——这就是为什么你能听到邻居家的低音！",
        "错误。尽管空气间隙有助于声音传播，但声音也通过固体材料的振动直接传播。",
        "错误。墙壁实际上会减少声音，而不是放大它。部分声音仍会通过振动传递过来。"

      "explanations_en": [
        "Correct! Loud sounds create powerful pressure waves that can damage delicate hair cells in your inner ear. These cells don't regenerate! That's why hearing protection matters—damage from loud noise is permanent.",
        "Wrong. Sound doesn't fill space like liquid. Damage comes from excessive vibration intensity.",
        "Wrong. Sound waves don't carry significant heat. The damage is mechanical, from excessive vibration.",

        "没错！巨大的声音会产生强烈的压力波，损伤内耳中脆弱的毛细胞。这些细胞一旦受损便无法再生！因此，保护听力至关重要——噪音造成的损害是永久性的。",
        "错误。声音不会像液体那样充满空间。损害来自于过度的振动强度。",

        "Wrong. Helium doesn't physically affect your vocal cords. They vibrate at the same frequency.",
        "Wrong. Breathing rate doesn't cause the voice change. It's about how sound travels through the gas.",
        "Correct! Sound travels nearly 3 times faster in helium than in air. This changes the resonance in your throat and mouth, boosting higher frequencies. Your vocal cords work normally—only the sound quality changes!",
        "Wrong. Helium molecules vibrate similarly to air. The effect comes from sound's different speed in helium."

        "Wrong. Quietness alone doesn't guarantee calm. Some quiet sounds (like whispers) can be unsettling.",
        "Correct! Gentle, predictable sounds with slow rhythms activate our parasympathetic nervous system. Nature sounds like rain, waves, or birdsong have patterns our brains evolved with. Sudden, unpredictable sounds trigger alertness instead!",
        "Wrong. Bass frequencies can be calming (like thunder in rain sounds). Calmness comes from patterns, not frequency ranges.",
