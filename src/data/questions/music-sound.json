        "Wrong. Temperature affects pitch slightly but doesn't explain why a piano sounds different from a violin playing the same note.",
        "Correct! Each instrument produces a unique mix of overtones (harmonics) along with the main note. A violin and piano playing the same note have different overtone patterns—that's their timbre or 'color' of sound!",
        "Wrong. Sound travels at the same speed regardless of instrument. The difference is in the sound wave patterns produced.",
        "Wrong. Our ears hear all instruments similarly. The difference is in the actual sound waves each instrument produces."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。温度对音高有轻微影响，但无法解释为什么钢琴和小提琴弹奏同一个音符听起来不同。",
        "正确！每种乐器在发出主音的同时，会产生独特的泛音组合。小提琴和钢琴弹奏同一个音符时，泛音模式不同——这就是它们的音色或声音'色彩'！",
        "错误。声音传播速度与乐器无关，差异在于产生的声波模式。",
        "错误。我们的耳朵对所有乐器的听觉方式相似，差异在于每种乐器实际产生的声波。"

        "Correct! Sound waves reflect off hard surfaces like walls, cliffs, or buildings. The reflected sound reaches your ears after the original, creating an echo. Soft surfaces absorb sound, which is why echoes are clearer in empty rooms!",
        "Wrong. Air doesn't carry sound twice. The echo is a reflection of the original sound wave bouncing back.",
        "Wrong. Ears don't have replay function. You hear actual reflected sound waves arriving after the original.",
        "Wrong. Sound waves don't split to create echoes. They bounce off surfaces intact."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "正确！声波会从墙壁、悬崖或建筑物等坚硬表面反射回来。反射的声音在原始声音之后到达你的耳朵，形成回声。柔软表面会吸收声音，这就是为什么在空房间里回声更清晰！",
        "错误。空气不会两次传递声音。回声是原始声波反弹回来的反射。",
        "错误。耳朵没有重放功能。你听到的是实际反射的声波，它们在原始声音之后到达。",
        "错误。声波不会分裂来产生回声。它们会完整地从表面反弹回来。"

        "Wrong. High-quality recordings preserve sound accurately. The strange feeling comes from hearing your voice externally.",
        "Correct! You normally hear your voice through skull vibrations AND air. Recordings only capture the air portion. Without bone conduction, your voice sounds higher and thinner—that's the real external sound of your voice!",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. Sound travels through solid walls, not through holes. Even sealed walls transmit some sound.",
        "Correct! Sound waves make wall molecules vibrate, passing energy through the solid material. The wall then vibrates air on the other side. Low frequencies travel through walls better than high ones—that's why you hear bass from neighbors!",
        "Wrong. While air gaps help sound travel, sound also moves directly through solid materials by vibration.",
        "Wrong. Walls actually reduce sound, they don't amplify it. Some sound still gets through via vibration."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。声音是通过固体墙壁传播的，不是通过孔洞。即使密封的墙壁也能传递一些声音。",
        "正确！声波使墙壁分子振动，能量穿过固体材料。墙壁再振动另一侧的空气。低频声音比高频更容易穿过墙壁——这就是为什么你能听到邻居的低音！",
        "错误。虽然空气缝隙有助于声音传播，但声音也通过振动直接在固体材料中移动。",
        "错误。墙壁实际上会减弱声音，不会放大它。一些声音仍通过振动传过来。"

      "explanations_en": [
        "Correct! Loud sounds create powerful pressure waves that can damage delicate hair cells in your inner ear. These cells don't regenerate! That's why hearing protection matters—damage from loud noise is permanent.",
        "Wrong. Sound doesn't fill space like liquid. Damage comes from excessive vibration intensity.",
        "Wrong. Sound waves don't carry significant heat. The damage is mechanical, from excessive vibration.",

        "Wrong. Helium doesn't physically affect your vocal cords. They vibrate at the same frequency.",
        "Wrong. Breathing rate doesn't cause the voice change. It's about how sound travels through the gas.",
        "Correct! Sound travels nearly 3 times faster in helium than in air. This changes the resonance in your throat and mouth, boosting higher frequencies. Your vocal cords work normally—only the sound quality changes!",
        "Wrong. Helium molecules vibrate similarly to air. The effect comes from sound's different speed in helium."

        "Wrong. Quietness alone doesn't guarantee calm. Some quiet sounds (like whispers) can be unsettling.",
        "Correct! Gentle, predictable sounds with slow rhythms activate our parasympathetic nervous system. Nature sounds like rain, waves, or birdsong have patterns our brains evolved with. Sudden, unpredictable sounds trigger alertness instead!",
        "Wrong. Bass frequencies can be calming (like thunder in rain sounds). Calmness comes from patterns, not frequency ranges.",

        "Wrong. Earworms happen with songs we dislike too. It's about how our brain processes incomplete musical patterns.",
