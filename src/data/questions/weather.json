        "Wrong. Rain clouds aren't dirty - they're made of the same water droplets as white clouds. The darkness comes from their thickness, not contamination.",
        "Correct! All clouds scatter sunlight, making them white. But rain clouds are much thicker and denser. As light passes through, most gets absorbed before reaching the bottom. Less light escapes, making them appear dark gray. The darker the cloud, the more water it holds, so rain is more likely!",
        "Wrong. All clouds are made of water droplets or ice crystals. Rain clouds appear dark because they're thicker and denser, not because they're made of different materials.",

        "Wrong. Lightning itself doesn't travel - it's a discharge. The difference is that we see the light instantly because light travels much faster than the sound (thunder) travels to reach us.",
        "Correct! Lightning and thunder happen at the same instant. But light travels at 300,000 km/s while sound only travels at 0.3 km/s - about a million times slower! So you see the flash almost instantly, but the sound takes time to reach you. Count the seconds between flash and thunder, divide by 3 to get distance in kilometers!",

        "Correct! Sunlight is white, containing all colors. When it hits Earth's atmosphere, tiny air molecules scatter it. Blue light has shorter waves that scatter more easily than other colors. So blue light bounces everywhere in the sky while other colors pass through more directly, making the sky appear blue.",

        "Wrong. Earth's rotation does affect wind direction (Coriolis effect), but it doesn't create wind. Wind is created by air pressure differences caused by uneven heating of Earth's surface.",
        "Correct! Wind happens because air moves from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. The sun heats Earth's surface unevenly - some areas get warmer, creating low pressure as warm air rises. Cooler air (high pressure) rushes in to fill the space, creating wind. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the wind!",

        "Wrong. Higher altitudes actually receive more direct sunlight with less atmospheric filtering. But the air can't hold that heat effectively due to lower pressure.",
        "Wrong. While air is thinner at altitude, this isn't the main reason. The key is that rising air expands due to lower pressure, and expansion causes cooling through a process called adiabatic cooling.",
        "Correct! As air rises, atmospheric pressure decreases. Lower pressure allows air to expand, and when gases expand, they cool down - this is adiabatic cooling. Temperature drops about 6.5°C per kilometer of altitude. So even though you're closer to the sun on a mountain, the air is much colder!",

        "正确！随着空气上升，大气压降低。较低的压力使空气膨胀，气体膨胀时会冷却——这就是绝热冷却。温度每升高一公里下降约6.5°C。所以即使你在山上离太阳更近，空气却冷得多！",

This often happens at night when the ground cools, chilling the air above it. Millions of suspended water droplets scatter light, reducing visibility. Fog is basically a cloud at ground level!",

        "Wrong. Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect) affects large systems like hurricanes but is too weak to create tornadoes. Tornado spin comes from wind shear - winds at different heights moving in different directions.",
        "Correct! Tornadoes form when winds at different heights blow in different directions or speeds (wind shear). This creates a horizontal spinning effect. When a powerful thunderstorm updraft tilts this rotation vertical and tightens it, a tornado forms. As the spinning column narrows (conservation of angular momentum), it spins faster - like a figure skater pulling in their arms!",
        "Wrong. While rising hot air is part of thunderstorms, it doesn't create the spin. Tornado rotation comes from wind shear being tilted vertical by updrafts, then tightening into a vortex.",
        "Wrong. Lightning is an electrical discharge and doesn't create spinning air. Tornado rotation comes from wind shear - different wind speeds at different heights creating rotation that gets tilted and tightened by updrafts."

        "错误。地球自转（科里奥利效应）影响飓风等大型系统，但太弱无法产生龙卷风。龙卷风旋转来自风切变——不同高度的风向不同方向移动。",
        "正确！龙卷风在不同高度的风以不同方向或速度吹动（风切变）时形成。这产生水平旋转效应。当强大的雷暴上升气流将这种旋转倾斜为垂直并收紧时，龙卷风就形成了。随着旋转柱变窄（角动量守恒），它旋转得更快——就像花样滑冰运动员收拢手臂！",
        "错误。虽然上升的热空气是雷暴的一部分，但它不会产生旋转。龙卷风旋转来自被上升气流倾斜为垂直的风切变，然后收紧成涡旋。",
        "错误。闪电是放电，不会产生旋转空气。龙卷风旋转来自风切变——不同高度的不同风速产生旋转，被上升气流倾斜并收紧。"

        "Wrong. While plants do transpire water, dew comes from water vapor in the air, not from plants. It forms when air cools enough for its moisture to condense on cool surfaces.",
        "Correct! At night, grass and ground cool by radiating heat to space. Air touching these cool surfaces drops below its dew point - the temperature where water vapor condenses. Moisture in the air then condenses into droplets on the cool grass. Clear, calm nights create the most dew because heat radiates away efficiently without clouds or wind!",
        "Wrong. Dew isn't fog settling - it's water vapor condensing directly onto cool surfaces. Fog is suspended droplets in air; dew forms on surfaces when they cool below the air's dew point.",

        "Wrong. Wind doesn't have to be colder - even at the same temperature, wind feels colder than still air. The difference is that wind constantly removes the warm air layer near your skin.",
        "Correct! Your body warms a thin layer of air next to your skin. In still air, this warm layer insulates you.

This 'wind chill' effect makes 10°C with wind feel much colder than 10°C without wind!",
