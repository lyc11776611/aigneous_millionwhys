        "Wrong. Rain clouds aren't dirty - they're made of the same water droplets as white clouds. The darkness comes from their thickness, not contamination.",
        "Correct! All clouds scatter sunlight, making them white. But rain clouds are much thicker and denser. As light passes through, most gets absorbed before reaching the bottom. Less light escapes, making them appear dark gray. The darker the cloud, the more water it holds, so rain is more likely!",

        "Correct! Wind happens because air moves from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. The sun heats Earth's surface unevenly - some areas get warmer, creating low pressure as warm air rises. Cooler air (high pressure) rushes in to fill the space, creating wind. The greater the pressure difference, the stronger the wind!",

        "Wrong. While air is thinner at altitude, this isn't the main reason. The key is that rising air expands due to lower pressure, and expansion causes cooling through a process called adiabatic cooling.",
        "Correct! As air rises, atmospheric pressure decreases. Lower pressure allows air to expand, and when gases expand, they cool down - this is adiabatic cooling. Temperature drops about 6.5°C per kilometer of altitude. So even though you're closer to the sun on a mountain, the air is much colder!",

        "Wrong. While humid air is slightly denser, this doesn't affect breathing. Discomfort comes from your body's inability to cool itself through sweat evaporation.",
        "Correct! Your body cools itself by sweating - as sweat evaporates from your skin, it takes heat with it. But evaporation requires dry air. In high humidity, air is already saturated with water vapor, so sweat can't evaporate. It just sits on your skin, leaving you hot, sticky, and unable to cool down effectively!",
