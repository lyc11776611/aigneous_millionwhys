        "Wrong. Air doesn't come from inside soap. The foam is created when soap molecules trap air from outside.",
        "Correct! Soap molecules reduce water's surface tension and form stretchy films. These films trap air, creating bubbles. Agitation introduces more air, making foam. More soap means more stable bubbles!",
        "Wrong. Water alone doesn't foam—try shaking pure water. Soap's unique molecular structure is what enables foam formation.",
        "Wrong. Foam forms even in clean water with no dirt. It's the soap's ability to create stable air bubbles, not a cleaning reaction."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。空气并非来自肥皂内部，而是肥皂分子从外部捕捉空气形成泡沫。",
        "正确！肥皂分子降低水的表面张力，形成弹性薄膜，捕捉空气形成气泡。搅动引入更多空气，产生泡沫；肥皂越多，气泡越稳定！",
        "错误。纯水不会起泡——试试摇晃纯水。肥皂的独特分子结构才是泡沫形成的关键。",
        "错误。即使在无污垢的干净水中，肥皂也能产生泡沫，这是因为肥皂能形成稳定的气泡，而非清洁反应。"

      "explanations_en": [
        "Wrong. Adhesive doesn't evaporate significantly. The loss of stickiness comes from chemical changes in the adhesive itself.",
        "Correct! Tape adhesive slowly oxidizes and loses its flexibility. UV light and heat speed up this process. The once-soft, tacky adhesive becomes hard and brittle, losing its ability to form bonds with surfaces.",
        "Wrong. While dust can reduce stickiness, old tape loses adhesion even when kept clean. The chemical breakdown of adhesive is the main cause.",

        "Wrong. Plastic doesn't contain water to dry out. The brittleness comes from chemical changes in the polymer structure.",
        "Wrong. Color fading and brittleness are both caused by UV damage, but bleaching isn't why plastic becomes brittle.",
        "Correct! UV light breaks the long molecular chains that make plastic flexible. Shorter chains can't bend without breaking. Heat and oxygen also contribute. That's why outdoor plastics degrade faster!",
        "Wrong. Air doesn't dissolve plastic. Oxygen can contribute to degradation, but the main issue is UV breaking molecular bonds."

        "错误。塑料不含水分，不会变干。变脆源于聚合物结构的化学变化。",
        "错误。颜色褪色和变脆都由紫外线损伤引起，但漂白不是变脆的原因。",
        "正确！紫外线破坏使塑料柔韧的长分子链。短链无法弯曲而断裂。热和氧气也加速降解，所以户外塑料坏得更快！",
        "错误。空气不会溶解塑料。氧气可能促进降解，但主要问题是紫外线破坏分子键。"
