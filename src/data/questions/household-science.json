        "Wrong. Air doesn't come from inside soap. The foam is created when soap molecules trap air from outside.",
        "Correct! Soap molecules reduce water's surface tension and form stretchy films. These films trap air, creating bubbles. Agitation introduces more air, making foam. More soap means more stable bubbles!",
        "Wrong. Water alone doesn't foam—try shaking pure water. Soap's unique molecular structure is what enables foam formation.",
        "Wrong. Foam forms even in clean water with no dirt. It's the soap's ability to create stable air bubbles, not a cleaning reaction."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "不对。空气并非来自肥皂内部。泡沫是在肥皂分子捕捉外部空气时形成的。",
        "正确！肥皂分子能降低水的表面张力并形成有弹性的薄膜。这些薄膜包裹空气形成气泡。搅动会带入更多空气，从而产生泡沫。肥皂越多，气泡越稳定！",
        "不对。单靠水是不会起泡的——试试摇晃纯净水就知道了。肥皂独特的分子结构才是泡沫形成的关键。",
        "不对。即使在无污垢的清洁水中也会形成泡沫。这是肥皂产生稳定气泡的能力，而非清洁反应。"

        "Wrong. Adhesive doesn't evaporate significantly. The loss of stickiness comes from chemical changes in the adhesive itself.",
        "Correct! Tape adhesive slowly oxidizes and loses its flexibility. UV light and heat speed up this process. The once-soft, tacky adhesive becomes hard and brittle, losing its ability to form bonds with surfaces.",
        "Wrong. While dust can reduce stickiness, old tape loses adhesion even when kept clean. The chemical breakdown of adhesive is the main cause.",

        "Wrong. Plastic doesn't contain water to dry out. The brittleness comes from chemical changes in the polymer structure.",
        "Wrong. Color fading and brittleness are both caused by UV damage, but bleaching isn't why plastic becomes brittle.",
        "Correct! UV light breaks the long molecular chains that make plastic flexible. Shorter chains can't bend without breaking. Heat and oxygen also contribute. That's why outdoor plastics degrade faster!",
        "Wrong. Air doesn't dissolve plastic. Oxygen can contribute to degradation, but the main issue is UV breaking molecular bonds."

        "错误。塑料不含水分，不会干燥变脆。其脆性源于聚合物结构的化学变化。",
        "错误。颜色褪色和变脆都是由紫外线损伤引起的，但漂白并非塑料变脆的原因。",
        "没错！紫外线会破坏使塑料具有柔韧性的长分子链。较短的链在弯曲时容易断裂。热量和氧气也会加速这一过程。这就是为什么户外塑料制品老化得更快！",
        "不对。空气不会溶解塑料。氧气可能促进降解，但主要问题是紫外线破坏分子键。"
