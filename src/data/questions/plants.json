        "Correct! Leaves contain chlorophyll, which absorbs red and blue light for photosynthesis. Green light is not absorbed, so it bounces back to our eyes. That's why leaves look green. This color isn't random - chlorophyll evolved to capture the most useful light wavelengths for making food!",

By dropping leaves, trees reduce water loss and save energy. They seal off leaves with a special layer, reabsorb nutrients, then let them fall. It's called dormancy!",

This makes it efficient to keep them year-round rather than regrow annually. Needle shape, waxy cuticle, and sunken stomata all reduce water loss.
