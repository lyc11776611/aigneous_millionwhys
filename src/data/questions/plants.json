By dropping leaves, trees reduce water loss and save energy. They seal off leaves with a special layer, reabsorb nutrients, then let them fall. It's called dormancy!",

        "Correct! Onion layers are actually modified leaves called 'scales' attached to a short underground stem (bulb). The bulb is a storage organ where the onion saves food (sugars) made during photosynthesis. Each fleshy layer is a scale leaf packed with nutrients. This stored energy helps the onion survive dormancy and quickly grow when conditions improve. Not all onions form bulbs - green onions don't!",
        "Wrong. Onion layers aren't for insect protection. They're modified leaves that store food (sugars and nutrients) for the plant. The onion bulb is an underground storage organ for surviving unfavorable conditions.",
        "Wrong. Layers don't represent multiple seasons. Each layer is a modified leaf scale that stores food. The bulb forms in one season as a survival strategy, storing nutrients for dormancy and future growth.",
        "Wrong. Onion layers don't help absorb water - that's the job of roots below the bulb. Layers are modified leaves that store food produced by the green leaves above ground."

        "正确！洋葱层实际上是附着在短地下茎（鳞茎）上的变形叶，称为'鳞片'。鳞茎是一个储存器官，洋葱在那里保存光合作用制造的食物（糖）。每一肉质层都是充满营养的鳞片叶。这种储存的能量帮助洋葱度过休眠期，并在条件改善时快速生长。不是所有洋葱都形成鳞茎——大葱就不！",
        "错误。洋葱层不是为了防御昆虫。它们是储存植物食物（糖和营养）的变形叶。洋葱鳞茎是一个地下储存器官，用于在不利条件下生存。",
        "错误。层不代表多个季节。每层都是储存食物的变形叶鳞片。鳞茎在一个季节形成作为生存策略，储存养分用于休眠和未来生长。",
        "错误。洋葱层不帮助吸水——那是鳞茎下面根的工作。层是变形叶，储存地上绿叶产生的食物。"

        "Correct! Seeds need soil for multiple reasons: it provides physical support for roots to anchor, holds moisture for germination, supplies mineral nutrients once the seed's stored food runs out, and offers protection. Soil structure allows air circulation for root respiration. However, seeds don't absolutely need soil - hydroponics proves plants can grow in water with dissolved nutrients. But soil is nature's perfect growing medium!",
        "Wrong. Seeds can actually germinate and grow without soil! Hydroponic systems grow plants in water with dissolved nutrients. Soil is ideal because it provides support, nutrients, and moisture, but it's not absolutely required.",
        "Wrong. Seeds don't need soil to protect from sunlight. Many seeds actually need light to germinate. Soil provides physical support, nutrients, and moisture - that's why it's important.",
        "Wrong. Soil doesn't 'activate' germination - water, oxygen, and suitable temperature do. Soil is important because it provides support, retains moisture, and supplies nutrients, but germination can happen without it (like in wet paper towels)."

        "Correct! This is called nyctinasty - sleep movements controlled by circadian rhythms. Plants like prayer plants, mimosa, and clover fold leaves at night to conserve energy and water, reduce heat loss, and protect from nighttime cold. Special cells at leaf bases (pulvini) change pressure to move leaves. Some theories suggest it reduces fungal infection risk or prevents predation. It's not true sleep, but rhythmic daily movements!",
        "Wrong. Plants don't sleep like animals (no brain or nervous system). Nyctinasty is a circadian rhythm response where plants fold leaves to conserve water, reduce heat loss, and protect from cold - not actual sleep.",
        "Wrong. While closing might incidentally deter some insects, the main purpose of nyctinasty is conserving water and energy, reducing heat loss, and protecting from cold temperatures at night through circadian-controlled movements.",
        "Wrong. Most plants that close at night are folding leaves, not flowers. Flower closing (different mechanism) does protect pollen, but leaf nyctinasty is about conserving water, energy, and reducing heat loss through circadian rhythms."

        "错误。大多数夜间闭合的植物是折叠叶子，而非花朵。花朵闭合（不同机制）确实保护花粉，但叶片感夜性是通过昼夜节律节省水分、能量和减少热量损失。"
