        "Wrong. While warm-ups burn some calories, that's not their purpose. The goal is preparing the body for intense activity.",
        "Correct! Warming up gradually increases heart rate and blood flow, delivering more oxygen to muscles. Warmer muscles are more flexible and contract more efficiently, reducing injury risk!",
