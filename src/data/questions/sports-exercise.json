        "Correct! Exercise creates microscopic tears in muscle fibers. Your body repairs these, building stronger muscles. This repair process causes inflammation and soreness—it's actually a sign of getting stronger!",
        "Wrong. Oxygen deprivation causes immediate fatigue, not delayed soreness. The pain comes from muscle fiber damage and repair.",

        "不对哦~缺氧会立刻感到疲劳，但延迟酸痛来自肌肉纤维的损伤修复过程",
        "错啦！运动时和运动后血流反而会增加。延迟酸痛其实是肌肉修复的'施工噪音'呢"

        "Wrong. While warm-ups burn some calories, that's not their purpose. The goal is preparing the body for intense activity.",
        "Correct! Warming up gradually increases heart rate and blood flow, delivering more oxygen to muscles. Warmer muscles are more flexible and contract more efficiently, reducing injury risk!",

        "Wrong. The physical motion doesn't cause faster breathing. Your brain increases breathing rate based on oxygen and CO2 levels.",
