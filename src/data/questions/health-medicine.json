        "Correct! Platelets rush to wounds and stick together, forming a plug. Then proteins create fibrin threads that weave a stronger clot. This amazing process happens in minutes to prevent blood loss!",
        "Wrong. Skin takes days to heal fully. Bleeding stops because blood clots form, not because skin regrows.",
        "Wrong. Blood continues flowing through your body. Clotting at the wound site stops the bleeding.",

        "Correct! Cold causes blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). Less blood flow means less fluid leaks into injured tissue. This reduces swelling and inflammation. That's why RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) helps injuries!",
        "Wrong. Ice doesn't kill cells when used properly. It reduces blood flow and inflammation.",
