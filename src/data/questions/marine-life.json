        "错误。海水不促进再生。海星有干细胞能转化为所需组织类型，这才是再生原因。"

        "Wrong. While coral polyps do extend at night to feed, movement alone doesn't define animals. Some animals never move, and some plants do move.",
        "Wrong. Coral actually does need sunlight—but for the algae living inside it. The coral itself is still an animal regardless of light needs.",
        "Correct! Corals are colonies of tiny animals called polyps that catch and digest food using stinging tentacles. Unlike plants, they can't make their own food through photosynthesis—they must eat to survive!",
        "Wrong. Both animals and plants produce carbon dioxide through respiration. What makes coral an animal is that it actively catches and consumes food."

        "错误。虽然珊瑚虫晚上会伸展捕食，但移动本身不能定义动物。有些动物从不移动，有些植物也会动。",
        "错误。珊瑚其实需要阳光——但这是为了它体内的藻类。珊瑚本身是动物，与光照需求无关。",
        "正确！珊瑚是由微小动物珊瑚虫组成的群体，它们用带刺的触手捕捉并消化食物。与植物不同，它们无法通过光合作用自造食物——必须靠吃来生存！",
        "错误。动物和植物都会通过呼吸产生二氧化碳。珊瑚是动物的关键在于它会主动捕捉并消耗食物。"
