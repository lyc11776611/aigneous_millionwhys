        "错误。没有骨骼并不能解释再生能力。许多无骨动物无法再生。海星拥有特殊的细胞能力，使其能够重新生长。",
        "正确！海星体内遍布着能够分化成任何细胞类型的干细胞。当一只腕足脱落时，这些细胞会增殖分化，重建完整的肢体——某些物种甚至仅凭一条腕足就能再生出整个身体！",
        "错误。实际上，海星的腕足内含有重要器官！每条腕足都有消化腺和部分神经系统。它们之所以能再生，是因为干细胞的能力，而不是因为腕足不重要。",
        "不对。海水并不能促进再生。海星之所以具备这种能力，是因为它们拥有能够转化为再生所需任何组织类型的干细胞。"

        "Wrong. While coral polyps do extend at night to feed, movement alone doesn't define animals. Some animals never move, and some plants do move.",
        "Wrong. Coral actually does need sunlight—but for the algae living inside it. The coral itself is still an animal regardless of light needs.",
        "Correct! Corals are colonies of tiny animals called polyps that catch and digest food using stinging tentacles. Unlike plants, they can't make their own food through photosynthesis—they must eat to survive!",
        "Wrong. Both animals and plants produce carbon dioxide through respiration. What makes coral an animal is that it actively catches and consumes food."

        "错误。虽然珊瑚虫确实在夜间伸展捕食，但仅凭移动并不能定义动物。有些动物从不移动，而有些植物却会移动。",
        "错误。珊瑚确实需要阳光——但这是为了生活在其中的藻类。无论对光的需求如何，珊瑚本身仍是动物。",
        "正确！珊瑚是由名为珊瑚虫的微小动物组成的群体，它们利用带刺的触手捕捉并消化食物。与植物不同，珊瑚无法通过光合作用自造食物——它们必须进食才能生存！",
        "错误。动物和植物都通过呼吸作用产生二氧化碳。珊瑚之所以是动物，是因为它会主动捕捉并摄取食物。"
