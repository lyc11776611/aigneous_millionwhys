        "Wrong. While onions do have strong compounds, it's not just 'spiciness' causing tears. The specific mechanism involves a chemical reaction that produces sulfuric acid in your eyes.",
        "Correct! When you cut onions, enzymes are released that react with sulfur compounds to create a gas. This gas reaches your eyes and reacts with your tears to form sulfuric acid. Your eyes produce more tears to wash away the irritation. Chilling onions helps reduce this reaction!",
        "Wrong. It's not the smell that triggers tears. The gas from onions chemically reacts with the moisture in your eyes to form acid, which causes the irritation and tearing.",
        "Wrong. There are no particles from onions irritating your eyes. It's actually a gas (propanethial S-oxide) that reaches your eyes and forms sulfuric acid when it mixes with tears."

        "Correct! Soap molecules are special: one end likes water, the other likes oil and grease. When you wash dishes, soap surrounds grease with its oil-loving ends, while water-loving ends face outward. This lets water rinse away the grease. It's like a molecular bridge between oil and water!",

        "Correct! At room temperature, metal and wood are the same temperature. But metal is a great heat conductor, so it quickly pulls heat from your warm hand. Wood is a poor conductor, so heat leaves your hand slowly. The faster heat loss makes metal feel colder, even though it isn't!",

        "Wrong. Air pressure inside and outside the bubble is nearly equal. While pressure plays a role in keeping the bubble inflated, it's not what makes it spherical. Surface tension is the key factor.",
        "Correct! Surface tension in the soap film pulls it into the shape with the smallest surface area for its volume - a sphere. Every point on a sphere is equidistant from the center, creating equal tension throughout. This minimizes energy, making spheres the most stable bubble shape!",

        "Correct! Yeast is a living microorganism that eats sugars in the dough and produces carbon dioxide gas as waste. These CO2 bubbles get trapped in the gluten network, making the dough expand. Heat from baking makes the gas expand more and kills the yeast, setting the fluffy structure!",
        "Wrong. While steam does form during baking and contributes slightly to rise, it's not the main cause. The primary rising comes from CO2 produced by yeast fermentation, which happens even before the dough goes in the oven.",

At about 180°C, the pressure reaches 9 times normal atmospheric pressure and the shell ruptures. The starch inside instantly expands into the fluffy white foam we love!",

        "Correct! Boiling happens when water's vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure. At 100°C at sea level, molecules have enough energy to form bubbles throughout the liquid, not just at the surface. Lower air pressure means less energy needed, so water boils at lower temperatures at high altitudes!",
