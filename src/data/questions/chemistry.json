        "Wrong. While onions do have strong compounds, it's not just 'spiciness' causing tears. The specific mechanism involves a chemical reaction that produces sulfuric acid in your eyes.",
        "Correct! When you cut onions, enzymes are released that react with sulfur compounds to create a gas. This gas reaches your eyes and reacts with your tears to form sulfuric acid. Your eyes produce more tears to wash away the irritation. Chilling onions helps reduce this reaction!",

        "Correct! Yeast is a living microorganism that eats sugars in the dough and produces carbon dioxide gas as waste. These CO2 bubbles get trapped in the gluten network, making the dough expand. Heat from baking makes the gas expand more and kills the yeast, setting the fluffy structure!",
