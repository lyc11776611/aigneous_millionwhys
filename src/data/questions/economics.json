        "Wrong. While stores do want profit, competition usually prevents them from just raising prices freely. The real cause is that each dollar becomes less valuable over time.",
        "Correct! This is called inflation. When governments print more money, each dollar becomes less valuable. With more money chasing the same goods, prices rise. A small amount of inflation is normal and healthy. But too much inflation means your money buys less over time. That's why $1 today buys less than in 1950!",
        "Wrong. While quality improvements can affect some prices, this doesn't explain the general upward trend of all prices over time, including basic commodities.",
        "Wrong. Demand fluctuates for different products and doesn't always rise. The consistent upward pressure on all prices comes from the increasing money supply reducing each dollar's value."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "错啦！虽然商店确实想多赚钱，但市场竞争通常会阻止它们随意涨价。真正的原因是，随着时间的推移，每一块钱的购买力会逐渐下降。",
        "对啦！这就是通货膨胀。当政府印更多钱时，每一块钱的购买力就变弱了。更多的钱追逐同样的商品，物价自然上涨。适度的通胀是正常且健康的，但通胀太高就意味着你的钱越来越不值钱。所以现在的一块钱能买到的东西比1950年少多啦！",
        "错啦！虽然质量提升会影响某些商品的价格，但这并不能解释所有物价（包括基本商品）长期普遍上涨的趋势。",
        "错啦！不同商品的需求会有波动，并不总是上升。所有物价持续上涨的压力主要来自货币供应增加导致每一块钱的购买力下降。"

        "Correct! Stock prices change based on supply and demand. When more people want to buy a stock, the price goes up. When more want to sell, it goes down. Investors buy or sell based on company performance, news, and future expectations. It's like an auction happening all day long!",
        "Wrong. Companies don't set their own stock prices after the initial public offering. The market determines prices through buying and selling activity.",

        "不对哦。客户忠诚度确实重要，但利息不是奖励计划。这是银行业务的核心——付钱获得存款，再以更高利率放贷赚钱。",

Japan makes cars efficiently, Brazil grows coffee well, Saudi Arabia has oil. By specializing and trading, everyone gets more goods at lower cost than making everything alone!",
