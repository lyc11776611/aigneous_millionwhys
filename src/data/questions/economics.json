        "Wrong. While stores do want profit, competition usually prevents them from just raising prices freely. The real cause is that each dollar becomes less valuable over time.",
        "Correct! This is called inflation. When governments print more money, each dollar becomes less valuable. With more money chasing the same goods, prices rise. A small amount of inflation is normal and healthy. But too much inflation means your money buys less over time. That's why $1 today buys less than in 1950!",
        "Wrong. While quality improvements can affect some prices, this doesn't explain the general upward trend of all prices over time, including basic commodities.",
        "Wrong. Demand fluctuates for different products and doesn't always rise. The consistent upward pressure on all prices comes from the increasing money supply reducing each dollar's value."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。虽然商店确实想要利润，但竞争通常会阻止它们随意提价。真正的原因是每一元钱随时间变得不那么值钱。",
        "正确！这叫做通货膨胀。当政府印更多钞票时，每一元钱变得不那么值钱。更多钱追逐同样的商品，价格就上涨。少量通胀是正常和健康的。但过多通胀意味着你的钱随时间购买力下降。这就是为什么今天1元买的东西比1950年少！",
        "错误。虽然质量提高会影响某些价格，但这不能解释所有价格随时间普遍上涨的趋势，包括基本商品。",
        "错误。不同产品的需求会波动，并不总是上升。所有价格持续上涨的压力来自货币供应增加导致每一元钱的价值降低。"

        "Wrong. While algorithms do participate in trading, they're not random. They follow rules based on market data. Stock prices are ultimately determined by what buyers and sellers agree to pay.",
        "Correct! Stock prices change based on supply and demand. When more people want to buy a stock, the price goes up. When more want to sell, it goes down. Investors buy or sell based on company performance, news, and future expectations. It's like an auction happening all day long!",
        "Wrong. Companies don't set their own stock prices after the initial public offering. The market determines prices through buying and selling activity.",

        "错误。公司在首次公开募股后不会设定自己的股价。市场通过买卖活动决定价格。",

        "Correct! Banks pay interest to attract your deposits. They then lend that money to others at higher interest rates. The difference is their profit. For example, they might pay you 2% but charge borrowers 6%. You get paid for letting them use your money, they profit from the spread!",
        "Wrong. While customer loyalty matters, interest is not a reward program. It's a fundamental part of banking business model - paying for deposits to relend at higher rates.",

        "错误。虽然银行业受到监管，但法律并不要求银行支付利息。银行支付利息是一种吸引存款的商业策略。",
        "正确！银行支付利息是为了吸引你的存款。然后他们以更高利率把钱借给别人。差额就是他们的利润。例如，他们可能付你2%，但向借款人收6%。你因让他们使用你的钱而获得报酬，他们从利差中获利！",
        "错误。虽然客户忠诚度很重要，但利息不是奖励计划。它是银行商业模式的基本部分——为存款付费以便以更高利率再贷出。",

Japan makes cars efficiently, Brazil grows coffee well, Saudi Arabia has oil. By specializing and trading, everyone gets more goods at lower cost than making everything alone!",

        "Wrong. Gold is not the most useful metal. Iron and copper are far more useful in daily life. Gold's value comes from different factors.",
        "Correct! Gold is valuable because it's rare, doesn't corrode, and societies agreed to value it for thousands of years. It has some uses in jewelry and electronics, but its high price is mainly because people believe it's valuable and want to own it. This is called market value!",
        "Wrong. While gold is used in some electronics due to good conductivity, it's not required for all devices. Many alternatives exist. Gold's high price is not justified by its industrial uses alone.",

        "错误。虽然黄金因良好的导电性用于某些电子产品，但并非所有设备都需要。存在许多替代品。黄金的高价不能仅由其工业用途来证明。",

Advertising creates demand, builds brand loyalty, and tells customers why their product is better than competitors. The money spent often returns as increased sales!",
