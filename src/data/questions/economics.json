        "Wrong. While stores do want profit, competition usually prevents them from just raising prices freely. The real cause is that each dollar becomes less valuable over time.",
        "Correct! This is called inflation. When governments print more money, each dollar becomes less valuable. With more money chasing the same goods, prices rise. A small amount of inflation is normal and healthy. But too much inflation means your money buys less over time. That's why $1 today buys less than in 1950!",
        "Wrong. While quality improvements can affect some prices, this doesn't explain the general upward trend of all prices over time, including basic commodities.",
        "Wrong. Demand fluctuates for different products and doesn't always rise. The consistent upward pressure on all prices comes from the increasing money supply reducing each dollar's value."
      ],
      "explanations_zh": [
        "不对。虽然商店确实追求利润，但竞争通常阻止它们随意涨价。真正的原因是随着时间的推移，每一美元的实际价值在下降。",
        "没错！这就是所谓的通货膨胀。当政府增发货币时，每一块钱的购买力就会下降。更多的货币追逐同样数量的商品，价格自然上涨。适度的通货膨胀是正常且健康的。但过高的通胀意味着你的钱会随着时间推移越来越不值钱。这就是为什么现在的一美元能买到的东西比1950年少得多！",
        "错误。虽然质量提升可能影响某些价格，但这并不能解释所有物价随时间普遍上涨的趋势，包括基本商品在内。",
        "错误。不同产品的需求会有波动，并非总是上升。所有价格持续上涨的压力源于货币供应量的增加，导致每美元价值下降。"

Japan makes cars efficiently, Brazil grows coffee well, Saudi Arabia has oil. By specializing and trading, everyone gets more goods at lower cost than making everything alone!",
