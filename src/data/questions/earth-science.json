        "Wrong. Earthquakes don't happen randomly. They occur at specific locations where tectonic plates meet and interact. Most earthquakes happen along fault lines, which are boundaries between plates.",
        "Correct! Earth's crust is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates that float on the semi-molten mantle below. These plates constantly move very slowly. When they grind against each other, get stuck, then suddenly slip, the stored energy is released as seismic waves - that's an earthquake! Most occur at plate boundaries.",
        "Wrong. While underground explosions (like nuclear tests) can cause minor tremors, natural earthquakes are caused by tectonic plate movements, not explosions. The energy comes from the slow buildup of stress along fault lines.",
        "Wrong. Gravity doesn't cause earthquakes. While gravity affects plate tectonics indirectly, earthquakes are caused by the movement and collision of tectonic plates driven by convection currents in Earth's mantle, not by gravity pulling the earth."

        "Wrong. It's not the mountain getting hot - the heat comes from deep inside Earth. Volcanoes form where magma from the mantle can reach the surface. The mountain is just the cone built up from previous eruptions.",
        "Correct! Deep underground, rock melts into magma due to extreme heat and pressure. Magma is less dense than surrounding rock, so it rises. As it rises, dissolved gases expand and pressure builds. When pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, the volcano erupts! Magma can reach the surface through cracks or weak spots in Earth's crust.",
        "Wrong. While gas bubbles in magma do contribute to explosive eruptions by expanding, they're not the primary cause. The fundamental cause is magma pressure. Gases make eruptions more violent, but pressure buildup from rising magma is what drives eruptions.",
        "Wrong. While earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are related (both occur at plate boundaries), earthquakes don't cause eruptions. Both are symptoms of tectonic activity. The eruption is caused by magma pressure, though earthquakes can sometimes trigger eruptions that were already ready to happen."

        "对啦！地下深处，岩石在高温高压下融化成岩浆。岩浆比周围岩石密度小，所以会上升。上升时溶解的气体膨胀，压力增大。当压力超过上覆岩石强度，火山就喷发啦！岩浆通过地壳裂缝或薄弱处到达地表。",
        "错啦！虽然岩浆中的气泡通过膨胀会加剧爆炸性喷发，但不是主要原因。根本原因是岩浆压力。气泡让喷发更猛烈，但上升岩浆的压力积累才是驱动喷发的关键。",
        "错啦！虽然地震和火山喷发有关（都发生在板块边界），但地震不会导致喷发。两者都是构造活动的表现。喷发由岩浆压力引起，不过地震有时会触发本就蓄势待发的喷发。"

        "Wrong. While precipitation does fall from clouds at high altitudes, this doesn't explain why it's snow rather than rain, or why snow stays on top. The key is that temperature decreases with altitude.",
        "Correct! Temperature decreases about 6.5°C per 1000 meters of altitude. This is called the environmental lapse rate. Above a certain altitude (the snow line), it's cold enough for precipitation to fall as snow and for snow to remain frozen year-round. Even tropical mountains can have permanent snow at high elevations! The thinner air also holds less heat.",
        "Wrong. Wind doesn't carry snow upward to deposit on mountains. Snow forms when water vapor in cold air crystallizes. Mountain tops are colder due to altitude, so precipitation falls as snow there and stays frozen.",
        "Wrong. Being closer to clouds doesn't make it colder. In fact, clouds form at various altitudes. Mountains have snow because temperature decreases with altitude due to lower air pressure and thinner atmosphere, which holds less heat. It's the cold temperature that creates and preserves snow."

        "错啦！虽然高海拔地区确实有降水，但这不能解释为什么是雪而不是雨，或者雪为什么能留在山顶。关键在于温度会随海拔升高而下降。",
        "对啦！海拔每升高1000米，温度大约下降6.5°C，这叫环境递减率。超过一定海拔（雪线），温度低到降水以雪的形式落下，并且雪能常年保持冰冻状态。就连热带的高山上也可能有永久积雪哦！稀薄的空气也储存不了多少热量。",
        "错啦！风并不会把雪吹到山顶堆积起来。雪是冷空气中的水蒸气结晶形成的。山顶因为海拔高而更冷，所以降水在那里以雪的形式落下并保持冰冻。",
        "错啦！离云更近并不会让温度变低。实际上，云可以在不同高度形成。山顶有雪是因为海拔升高导致温度下降，空气压力降低、大气变薄，储存的热量更少。是低温造就并保存了雪。"

        "Correct! Wind blowing across the ocean transfers energy to the water through friction. This creates ripples that grow into waves. Wave size depends on wind speed, how long it blows, and the distance (fetch) over which it blows. The water itself doesn't move forward - energy does! Only the wave form travels; water particles move in circular orbits.",

        "Correct! Sand is mostly tiny fragments of rocks and minerals, created by weathering and erosion over millions of years. Rivers carry these particles to the ocean, where waves and currents sort and deposit them on beaches. Beach sand composition varies - some is quartz from granite, some is volcanic rock, some is coral or shell fragments! White sand beaches have more shell and coral content.",
        "Wrong. While some beach sand does contain shell fragments, especially on tropical beaches, most sand comes from eroded rocks. Shells can break down into sand-sized particles but aren't the primary source. Rock erosion over geological time creates most beach sand.",

        "答对啦！沙子主要是岩石和矿物的微小碎片，经过数百万年的风化和侵蚀形成。河流把这些颗粒带到海洋，海浪和海流对它们进行分类并堆积在沙滩上。沙滩沙子的成分各不相同——有的是花岗岩中的石英，有的是火山岩，还有的是珊瑚或贝壳碎片！白色沙滩的贝壳和珊瑚含量更高哦。",

Rivers start at high elevations (mountains, hills) and flow toward the lowest point - usually the ocean. The land surface naturally slopes toward the sea. Rivers carve valleys over time, creating channels that guide the flow. All rivers eventually reach the ocean or an inland lake/sea at a lower elevation!",

        "Wrong. Wind creates regular ocean waves, not tsunamis. Tsunamis are different - they're caused by sudden displacement of massive amounts of water, usually from underwater earthquakes. Wind-driven waves only affect the surface; tsunamis involve the entire water column.",
        "Correct! Tsunamis are triggered by sudden vertical displacement of the seafloor, usually from underwater earthquakes at subduction zones. When tectonic plates suddenly shift, they push or pull huge volumes of water. This energy travels as waves at jet speed (up to 800 km/h) across the ocean! Underwater landslides and volcanic eruptions can also cause tsunamis. Wave height increases dramatically in shallow coastal waters.",
        "Wrong. The moon's gravity creates tides - slow, predictable rises and falls over 6-hour periods. Tsunamis are sudden, catastrophic waves triggered by geological events like underwater earthquakes or landslides. They're completely different phenomena.",
        "Wrong. Underwater volcanoes don't boil water to create tsunamis. However, violent volcanic explosions can displace water suddenly, creating tsunamis. But most tsunamis come from underwater earthquakes, not volcanic activity. It's the sudden movement of Earth's crust displacing water that creates these waves."

        "Correct! Glaciers move through two mechanisms: internal deformation and basal sliding. Under immense pressure from their own weight, ice crystals deform and flow like a very viscous fluid - gravity pulls them downhill. At the base, friction melts some ice, creating a thin water layer that acts as lubricant. Glaciers can move millimeters to meters per day! They've carved valleys and shaped landscapes over thousands of years.",

        "Correct! Most deserts form due to atmospheric circulation. At the equator, hot air rises and releases moisture as rain (tropical forests).

Rain shadow deserts form when mountains block moisture. Cold ocean currents and distance from water also create deserts.",
