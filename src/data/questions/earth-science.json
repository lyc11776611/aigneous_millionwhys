        "Wrong. Earthquakes don't happen randomly. They occur at specific locations where tectonic plates meet and interact. Most earthquakes happen along fault lines, which are boundaries between plates.",
        "Correct! Earth's crust is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates that float on the semi-molten mantle below. These plates constantly move very slowly. When they grind against each other, get stuck, then suddenly slip, the stored energy is released as seismic waves - that's an earthquake! Most occur at plate boundaries.",
        "Wrong. While underground explosions (like nuclear tests) can cause minor tremors, natural earthquakes are caused by tectonic plate movements, not explosions. The energy comes from the slow buildup of stress along fault lines.",
        "Wrong. Gravity doesn't cause earthquakes. While gravity affects plate tectonics indirectly, earthquakes are caused by the movement and collision of tectonic plates driven by convection currents in Earth's mantle, not by gravity pulling the earth."

        "错误。重力不会引起地震。虽然重力间接影响板块构造，但地震是由地球地幔中对流引起的地壳板块运动和碰撞引起的，而不是重力拉扯地球。"

        "Wrong. It's not the mountain getting hot - the heat comes from deep inside Earth. Volcanoes form where magma from the mantle can reach the surface. The mountain is just the cone built up from previous eruptions.",
        "Correct! Deep underground, rock melts into magma due to extreme heat and pressure. Magma is less dense than surrounding rock, so it rises. As it rises, dissolved gases expand and pressure builds. When pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, the volcano erupts! Magma can reach the surface through cracks or weak spots in Earth's crust.",
        "Wrong. While gas bubbles in magma do contribute to explosive eruptions by expanding, they're not the primary cause. The fundamental cause is magma pressure. Gases make eruptions more violent, but pressure buildup from rising magma is what drives eruptions.",
        "Wrong. While earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are related (both occur at plate boundaries), earthquakes don't cause eruptions. Both are symptoms of tectonic activity. The eruption is caused by magma pressure, though earthquakes can sometimes trigger eruptions that were already ready to happen."

        "错误。不是山体变热 - 热量来自地球深处。火山形成于地幔中的岩浆可以到达地表的地方。山只是由以前喷发堆积而成的锥体。",
        "正确！在地下深处，由于极端的热量和压力，岩石融化成岩浆。岩浆比周围的岩石密度小，所以上升。随着上升，溶解的气体膨胀，压力增加。当压力超过上覆岩石的强度时，火山就喷发了！岩浆可以通过地壳中的裂缝或薄弱点到达地表。",
        "错误。虽然岩浆中的气泡通过膨胀确实有助于爆炸性喷发，但它们不是主要原因。根本原因是岩浆压力。气体使喷发更猛烈，但上升岩浆的压力积累才是驱动喷发的原因。",
        "错误。虽然地震和火山喷发有关（两者都发生在板块边界），但地震不会引起喷发。两者都是构造活动的症状。喷发是由岩浆压力引起的，尽管地震有时可以触发已经准备好喷发的火山。"

        "Wrong. While precipitation does fall from clouds at high altitudes, this doesn't explain why it's snow rather than rain, or why snow stays on top. The key is that temperature decreases with altitude.",
        "Correct! Temperature decreases about 6.5°C per 1000 meters of altitude. This is called the environmental lapse rate. Above a certain altitude (the snow line), it's cold enough for precipitation to fall as snow and for snow to remain frozen year-round. Even tropical mountains can have permanent snow at high elevations! The thinner air also holds less heat.",
        "Wrong. Wind doesn't carry snow upward to deposit on mountains. Snow forms when water vapor in cold air crystallizes. Mountain tops are colder due to altitude, so precipitation falls as snow there and stays frozen.",
        "Wrong. Being closer to clouds doesn't make it colder. In fact, clouds form at various altitudes. Mountains have snow because temperature decreases with altitude due to lower air pressure and thinner atmosphere, which holds less heat. It's the cold temperature that creates and preserves snow."

        "错误。风不会将雪向上带到山上沉积。雪是在冷空气中水蒸气结晶时形成的。山顶由于海拔而更冷，所以降水以雪的形式落在那里并保持冰冻。",
        "错误。离云更近不会使其更冷。事实上，云在不同海拔形成。山有雪是因为温度随海拔降低，这是由于较低的气压和较薄的大气层，保持较少的热量。是寒冷的温度创造和保存雪。"

        "Correct! Wind blowing across the ocean transfers energy to the water through friction. This creates ripples that grow into waves. Wave size depends on wind speed, how long it blows, and the distance (fetch) over which it blows. The water itself doesn't move forward - energy does! Only the wave form travels; water particles move in circular orbits.",

Rivers carry these particles to the ocean, where waves and currents sort and deposit them on beaches. Beach sand composition varies - some is quartz from granite, some is volcanic rock, some is coral or shell fragments! White sand beaches have more shell and coral content.",

Underwater landslides and volcanic eruptions can also cause tsunamis. Wave height increases dramatically in shallow coastal waters.",

The earth acts as insulation, protecting groundwater from daily and seasonal temperature swings. This is why caves feel cool in summer and warm in winter! However, water gets warmer deeper down due to geothermal heat from Earth's interior.",

Under immense pressure from their own weight, ice crystals deform and flow like a very viscous fluid - gravity pulls them downhill.

They've carved valleys and shaped landscapes over thousands of years.",

Rain shadow deserts form when mountains block moisture. Cold ocean currents and distance from water also create deserts.",
