        "Wrong. Earthquakes don't happen randomly. They occur at specific locations where tectonic plates meet and interact. Most earthquakes happen along fault lines, which are boundaries between plates.",
        "Correct! Earth's crust is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates that float on the semi-molten mantle below. These plates constantly move very slowly. When they grind against each other, get stuck, then suddenly slip, the stored energy is released as seismic waves - that's an earthquake! Most occur at plate boundaries.",
        "Wrong. While underground explosions (like nuclear tests) can cause minor tremors, natural earthquakes are caused by tectonic plate movements, not explosions. The energy comes from the slow buildup of stress along fault lines.",
        "Wrong. Gravity doesn't cause earthquakes. While gravity affects plate tectonics indirectly, earthquakes are caused by the movement and collision of tectonic plates driven by convection currents in Earth's mantle, not by gravity pulling the earth."

        "Wrong. It's not the mountain getting hot - the heat comes from deep inside Earth. Volcanoes form where magma from the mantle can reach the surface. The mountain is just the cone built up from previous eruptions.",
        "Correct! Deep underground, rock melts into magma due to extreme heat and pressure. Magma is less dense than surrounding rock, so it rises. As it rises, dissolved gases expand and pressure builds. When pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, the volcano erupts! Magma can reach the surface through cracks or weak spots in Earth's crust.",
        "Wrong. While gas bubbles in magma do contribute to explosive eruptions by expanding, they're not the primary cause. The fundamental cause is magma pressure. Gases make eruptions more violent, but pressure buildup from rising magma is what drives eruptions.",
        "Wrong. While earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are related (both occur at plate boundaries), earthquakes don't cause eruptions. Both are symptoms of tectonic activity. The eruption is caused by magma pressure, though earthquakes can sometimes trigger eruptions that were already ready to happen."

        "不对。并非山体发热，热量源自地球深处。火山形成于地幔岩浆能够到达地表之处，而山体只是由先前喷发物堆积而成的锥形结构。",
        "正确！在地球深处，岩石因极高的温度和压力熔化成岩浆。岩浆密度低于周围岩石，因此会上升。上升过程中，溶解的气体膨胀，压力积聚。当压力超过上覆岩石的强度时，火山便会喷发！岩浆可通过地壳的裂缝或薄弱处抵达地表。",
        "错误。虽然岩浆中的气泡因膨胀而加剧了爆炸性喷发，但它们并非主要原因。根本原因在于岩浆压力。气体使喷发更为猛烈，但上升岩浆导致的压力积累才是驱动喷发的关键。",
        "错误。虽然地震和火山喷发有关联（两者都发生在板块边界），但地震并不会引发火山喷发。它们都是构造活动的表现。火山喷发是由岩浆压力引起的，尽管地震有时可能触发那些已经蓄势待发的喷发。"

        "Wrong. While precipitation does fall from clouds at high altitudes, this doesn't explain why it's snow rather than rain, or why snow stays on top. The key is that temperature decreases with altitude.",
        "Correct! Temperature decreases about 6.5°C per 1000 meters of altitude. This is called the environmental lapse rate. Above a certain altitude (the snow line), it's cold enough for precipitation to fall as snow and for snow to remain frozen year-round. Even tropical mountains can have permanent snow at high elevations! The thinner air also holds less heat.",
        "Wrong. Wind doesn't carry snow upward to deposit on mountains. Snow forms when water vapor in cold air crystallizes. Mountain tops are colder due to altitude, so precipitation falls as snow there and stays frozen.",
        "Wrong. Being closer to clouds doesn't make it colder. In fact, clouds form at various altitudes. Mountains have snow because temperature decreases with altitude due to lower air pressure and thinner atmosphere, which holds less heat. It's the cold temperature that creates and preserves snow."

        "错误。虽然降水确实从高空的云层中降落，但这并未解释为何是雪而非雨，或雪为何能停留在地表。关键在于温度随海拔升高而降低。",
        "正确！海拔每升高1000米，气温大约下降6.5摄氏度，这被称为环境递减率。在某个海拔高度（雪线）以上，气温足够低，使得降水以雪的形式落下，并且积雪能常年不化。即使是热带的高山，在高海拔地区也可能有终年积雪！此外，空气越稀薄，保温能力也越差。",
        "错误。风不会将雪吹上山堆积。雪是冷空气中的水蒸气结晶形成的。山顶因海拔高而更冷，因此降水以雪的形式落下并保持冻结状态。",
        "不对。离云更近并不会更冷。实际上，云在不同高度形成。山上有雪是因为随着海拔升高，气压降低、大气变薄，保温能力减弱导致温度下降。正是低温造就并维持了积雪。"

        "Correct! Wind blowing across the ocean transfers energy to the water through friction. This creates ripples that grow into waves. Wave size depends on wind speed, how long it blows, and the distance (fetch) over which it blows. The water itself doesn't move forward - energy does! Only the wave form travels; water particles move in circular orbits.",

        "Correct! Sand is mostly tiny fragments of rocks and minerals, created by weathering and erosion over millions of years. Rivers carry these particles to the ocean, where waves and currents sort and deposit them on beaches. Beach sand composition varies - some is quartz from granite, some is volcanic rock, some is coral or shell fragments! White sand beaches have more shell and coral content.",

Rivers start at high elevations (mountains, hills) and flow toward the lowest point - usually the ocean. The land surface naturally slopes toward the sea. Rivers carve valleys over time, creating channels that guide the flow. All rivers eventually reach the ocean or an inland lake/sea at a lower elevation!",

        "Correct! Tsunamis are triggered by sudden vertical displacement of the seafloor, usually from underwater earthquakes at subduction zones. When tectonic plates suddenly shift, they push or pull huge volumes of water. This energy travels as waves at jet speed (up to 800 km/h) across the ocean! Underwater landslides and volcanic eruptions can also cause tsunamis. Wave height increases dramatically in shallow coastal waters.",

Under immense pressure from their own weight, ice crystals deform and flow like a very viscous fluid - gravity pulls them downhill.
