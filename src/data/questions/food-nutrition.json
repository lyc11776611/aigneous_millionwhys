        "Wrong. While caramelization can occur, it requires higher temperatures (above 160°C) than typical toasting. The primary browning in toast comes from a different reaction between amino acids and sugars, not just sugar alone.",
        "Correct! The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids (from proteins) and reducing sugars when heated. This creates hundreds of flavor compounds and brown pigments called melanoidins. It's the same reaction that browns meat, coffee beans, and baked goods. The reaction starts around 140°C, perfect for toasting!",
        "Wrong. Toast isn't burning - that would make it black and taste burnt. The brown color comes from the Maillard reaction, a complex chemical process that creates new flavor compounds and brown pigments without charring the bread.",
        "Wrong. While water does evaporate during toasting, this doesn't cause browning. White bread with evaporated water would still be pale. The brown color specifically comes from the Maillard reaction between proteins and sugars creating new brown compounds."

        "错误。虽然焦糖化可能发生，但它需要比典型烘烤更高的温度（160°C以上）。面包片中的主要褐变来自氨基酸和糖之间的不同反应，而不仅仅是糖。",
        "正确！美拉德反应是氨基酸（来自蛋白质）和还原糖在加热时的化学反应。这产生数百种风味化合物和称为类黑素的褐色色素。这与使肉类、咖啡豆和烘焙食品变褐色的反应相同。反应在约140°C开始，非常适合烘烤！",
        "错误。面包片不是在燃烧 - 那会使它变黑并尝起来有烧焦味。褐色来自美拉德反应，这是一个复杂的化学过程，产生新的风味化合物和褐色色素，而不会使面包碳化。",
        "错误。虽然烘烤时水分确实会蒸发，但这不会导致褐变。蒸发水分的白面包仍然是苍白的。褐色特别来自蛋白质和糖之间的美拉德反应产生新的褐色化合物。"

        "Wrong. Salt doesn't absorb water like a sponge. The thirst sensation is more complex and involves your blood's salt concentration and how your cells respond to maintain balance.",
        "Correct! When you eat salty food, sodium concentration in your blood increases. This creates osmotic pressure - water moves from cells into the blood to dilute the salt. Your hypothalamus detects this cellular dehydration and triggers thirst. Drinking water restores the balance by diluting blood sodium and rehydrating cells!",
        "Wrong. While salty food might dry your mouth slightly, throat irritation doesn't cause the deep thirst you feel. The thirst comes from your brain detecting changes in blood salt concentration and cellular dehydration, not local throat sensation.",
        "Wrong. Salt doesn't significantly increase metabolism. The thirst response is specifically about maintaining osmotic balance. Your body needs to dilute the excess sodium in your bloodstream to protect cells from losing too much water through osmosis."

When capsaicin activates them, your brain receives a 'burning' signal even though there's no real heat. Your body responds as if overheating, triggering sweating to cool you down!",

        "Wrong. Many people drink coffee black without sugar. While sugar provides energy, it's not what keeps you awake. The alertness comes specifically from caffeine's effect on brain receptors, not from calories or sugar.",
        "Correct! Caffeine's molecular structure mimics adenosine, a neurotransmitter that builds up during the day and makes you sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain, preventing adenosine from binding and signaling tiredness. This keeps you alert! It takes about 30 minutes to peak and 3-5 hours to reduce by half.",

        "正确！咖啡因的分子结构模仿腺苷，这是一种在白天积累并使你困倦的神经递质。咖啡因阻断大脑中的腺苷受体，阻止腺苷结合并发出疲劳信号。这使你保持警觉！大约30分钟达到峰值，3-5小时减少一半。",
        "错误。你可以喝冰咖啡并仍然保持清醒。温度不会像咖啡因那样影响警觉性。刺激效果纯粹是化学的 - 咖啡因阻断大脑中促进睡眠的腺苷受体。",
        "错误。虽然咖啡的香气令人愉悦，可能提供心理提升，但实际的警觉性来自咖啡因化学地阻断腺苷受体。你从没有香气的咖啡因药片中也能获得同样的效果。"

        "Correct! Chocolate's main fat, cocoa butter, has a melting point of 34-38°C, just below human body temperature (37°C). When chocolate enters your mouth, body heat causes cocoa butter to melt, creating that smooth, creamy sensation. This unique melting property is why chocolate makers carefully control cocoa butter crystallization during tempering!",

        "Correct! As bananas ripen, cell walls break down releasing polyphenol oxidase enzyme. This enzyme reacts with phenolic compounds and oxygen, creating dark melanin pigments - the same process that browns apples! Ethylene gas produced by the banana accelerates ripening. Cold slows this enzyme activity, which is why refrigerated bananas stay yellow longer (though the skin still darkens).",

        "Wrong. Actually, human enzymes cannot break down fiber - that's exactly why it helps digestion! Fiber passes through largely intact, providing bulk. Some gut bacteria can ferment certain fibers, but we don't digest it ourselves.",
        "Correct! Dietary fiber is plant material our bodies can't digest. Insoluble fiber (from wheat bran, vegetables) adds bulk to stool and speeds intestinal transit, preventing constipation. Soluble fiber (from oats, beans) absorbs water forming gel, slowing digestion and helping you feel full. Fiber also feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce healthy short-chain fatty acids!",

        "Wrong. While citrus fruits are high in vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin C contributes only slightly to sourness. The main sour taste comes from citric acid, which is present in much higher concentrations than vitamin C.",
        "Correct! Citrus fruits contain high levels of citric acid (typically 5-8% in lemons). When you eat them, citric acid molecules release hydrogen ions (H+), lowering pH. Your tongue's sour taste receptors detect these hydrogen ions and signal 'sour' to your brain. Citric acid also acts as a natural preservative and antioxidant. Ripe citrus still tastes sour even with high sugar because acid dominates!",

        "Correct! Freezing preserves food by dramatically slowing down two things: microbial growth and enzyme activity. At freezing temperatures, water becomes ice, making it unavailable for chemical reactions and bacterial metabolism. Enzymes that cause food degradation become nearly inactive. Bacteria don't die but can't reproduce or cause spoilage. Below -18°C, food stays safe almost indefinitely, though quality may decline!",
