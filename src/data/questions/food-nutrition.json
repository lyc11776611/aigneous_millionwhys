        "Wrong. While caramelization can occur, it requires higher temperatures (above 160°C) than typical toasting. The primary browning in toast comes from a different reaction between amino acids and sugars, not just sugar alone.",
        "Correct! The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids (from proteins) and reducing sugars when heated. This creates hundreds of flavor compounds and brown pigments called melanoidins. It's the same reaction that browns meat, coffee beans, and baked goods. The reaction starts around 140°C, perfect for toasting!",
        "Wrong. Toast isn't burning - that would make it black and taste burnt. The brown color comes from the Maillard reaction, a complex chemical process that creates new flavor compounds and brown pigments without charring the bread.",
        "Wrong. While water does evaporate during toasting, this doesn't cause browning. White bread with evaporated water would still be pale. The brown color specifically comes from the Maillard reaction between proteins and sugars creating new brown compounds."

        "错误。虽然焦糖化可能发生，但需要高于160°C的温度，比普通烤面包高。面包变棕主要来自氨基酸和糖的不同反应，不只是糖本身。",
        "正确！美拉德反应是氨基酸（来自蛋白质）和还原糖在加热时的化学反应，产生数百种风味化合物和棕色色素——类黑精。这正是让肉类、咖啡豆和烘焙食品变棕的同一反应，始于约140°C，非常适合烤面包！",
        "错误。面包没有燃烧——那会变黑并尝起来焦糊。棕色来自美拉德反应，一种复杂的化学过程，在不烧焦面包的情况下创造新风味和棕色色素。",
        "错误。虽然烤面包时水分会蒸发，但这不会导致变棕。水分蒸发后的白面包仍会苍白。棕色特指蛋白质和糖的美拉德反应产生的新棕色化合物。"

        "Wrong. Salt doesn't absorb water like a sponge. The thirst sensation is more complex and involves your blood's salt concentration and how your cells respond to maintain balance.",
        "Correct! When you eat salty food, sodium concentration in your blood increases. This creates osmotic pressure - water moves from cells into the blood to dilute the salt. Your hypothalamus detects this cellular dehydration and triggers thirst. Drinking water restores the balance by diluting blood sodium and rehydrating cells!",
        "Wrong. While salty food might dry your mouth slightly, throat irritation doesn't cause the deep thirst you feel. The thirst comes from your brain detecting changes in blood salt concentration and cellular dehydration, not local throat sensation.",

        "Wrong. Spicy food doesn't actually raise your core body temperature significantly. The sweating happens because your brain thinks you're overheating due to chemical signals, not because you actually are.",
        "Correct! Capsaicin, the compound in chili peppers, binds to TRPV1 receptors in your mouth. These receptors normally detect actual heat (above 43°C). When capsaicin activates them, your brain receives a 'burning' signal even though there's no real heat. Your body responds as if overheating, triggering sweating to cool you down!",
        "Wrong. While eating does increase metabolism slightly, that's not why spicy food makes you sweat. The sweating is specifically triggered by capsaicin activating heat-sensing receptors, tricking your brain into thinking you need to cool down.",

        "Wrong. Many people drink coffee black without sugar. While sugar provides energy, it's not what keeps you awake. The alertness comes specifically from caffeine's effect on brain receptors, not from calories or sugar.",
        "Correct! Caffeine's molecular structure mimics adenosine, a neurotransmitter that builds up during the day and makes you sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain, preventing adenosine from binding and signaling tiredness. This keeps you alert! It takes about 30 minutes to peak and 3-5 hours to reduce by half.",
        "Wrong. You can drink iced coffee and still stay awake. Temperature doesn't affect alertness the way caffeine does. The stimulating effect is purely chemical - caffeine blocking sleep-promoting adenosine receptors in your brain.",

        "Correct! Chocolate's main fat, cocoa butter, has a melting point of 34-38°C, just below human body temperature (37°C). When chocolate enters your mouth, body heat causes cocoa butter to melt, creating that smooth, creamy sensation. This unique melting property is why chocolate makers carefully control cocoa butter crystallization during tempering!",

        "Correct! As bananas ripen, cell walls break down releasing polyphenol oxidase enzyme. This enzyme reacts with phenolic compounds and oxygen, creating dark melanin pigments - the same process that browns apples! Ethylene gas produced by the banana accelerates ripening. Cold slows this enzyme activity, which is why refrigerated bananas stay yellow longer (though the skin still darkens).",

        "Wrong. While protein can be used for energy, that's not its primary role in muscle building. Carbohydrates and fats are preferred energy sources. Protein's special role is providing amino acids for tissue repair and growth.",
        "Correct! Proteins are made of amino acids. During exercise, muscle fibers get microscopic tears. Your body uses amino acids from dietary protein to repair and rebuild these fibers, making them stronger and larger. This process is called muscle protein synthesis. Essential amino acids (especially leucine) trigger this synthesis. That's why athletes need more protein - typically 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight!",
        "Wrong. While exercise increases blood flow, protein itself doesn't directly increase circulation. Protein helps muscles by providing amino acids needed to repair and build muscle tissue after exercise-induced damage.",
        "Wrong. This is a common myth - fat cannot turn into muscle. They're completely different tissues. Protein helps build muscle by providing amino acids for muscle protein synthesis. Fat loss and muscle gain are separate processes that can happen simultaneously with proper diet and exercise."

        "Correct! Citrus fruits contain high levels of citric acid (typically 5-8% in lemons). When you eat them, citric acid molecules release hydrogen ions (H+), lowering pH. Your tongue's sour taste receptors detect these hydrogen ions and signal 'sour' to your brain. Citric acid also acts as a natural preservative and antioxidant. Ripe citrus still tastes sour even with high sugar because acid dominates!",

        "Correct! Freezing preserves food by dramatically slowing down two things: microbial growth and enzyme activity. At freezing temperatures, water becomes ice, making it unavailable for chemical reactions and bacterial metabolism. Enzymes that cause food degradation become nearly inactive. Bacteria don't die but can't reproduce or cause spoilage. Below -18°C, food stays safe almost indefinitely, though quality may decline!",
