        "Wrong. While caramelization can occur, it requires higher temperatures (above 160°C) than typical toasting. The primary browning in toast comes from a different reaction between amino acids and sugars, not just sugar alone.",
        "Correct! The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids (from proteins) and reducing sugars when heated. This creates hundreds of flavor compounds and brown pigments called melanoidins. It's the same reaction that browns meat, coffee beans, and baked goods. The reaction starts around 140°C, perfect for toasting!",
        "Wrong. Toast isn't burning - that would make it black and taste burnt. The brown color comes from the Maillard reaction, a complex chemical process that creates new flavor compounds and brown pigments without charring the bread.",
        "Wrong. While water does evaporate during toasting, this doesn't cause browning. White bread with evaporated water would still be pale. The brown color specifically comes from the Maillard reaction between proteins and sugars creating new brown compounds."

        "错误。虽然焦糖化反应确实可能发生，但它需要的温度（高于160°C）比普通烘烤要高。吐司的主要褐变来源于氨基酸和糖之间的另一种反应，而不仅仅是糖本身的作用。",
        "正确！美拉德反应是氨基酸（来自蛋白质）与还原糖在加热时发生的化学反应，产生数百种风味化合物和称为类黑精的棕色色素。这正是使肉类、咖啡豆和烘焙食品变褐的同一反应。该反应约在140°C开始，非常适合烘烤！",

        "错误。虽然烤面包时水分会蒸发，但这并非导致面包变黄的原因。即使水分蒸发，白面包仍会保持浅色。面包变成棕色具体是由于蛋白质和糖之间发生的美拉德反应，生成新的棕色化合物。"

        "Wrong. Salt doesn't absorb water like a sponge. The thirst sensation is more complex and involves your blood's salt concentration and how your cells respond to maintain balance.",
        "Correct! When you eat salty food, sodium concentration in your blood increases. This creates osmotic pressure - water moves from cells into the blood to dilute the salt. Your hypothalamus detects this cellular dehydration and triggers thirst. Drinking water restores the balance by diluting blood sodium and rehydrating cells!",
        "Wrong. While salty food might dry your mouth slightly, throat irritation doesn't cause the deep thirst you feel. The thirst comes from your brain detecting changes in blood salt concentration and cellular dehydration, not local throat sensation.",

        "Wrong. Spicy food doesn't actually raise your core body temperature significantly. The sweating happens because your brain thinks you're overheating due to chemical signals, not because you actually are.",
        "Correct! Capsaicin, the compound in chili peppers, binds to TRPV1 receptors in your mouth. These receptors normally detect actual heat (above 43°C). When capsaicin activates them, your brain receives a 'burning' signal even though there's no real heat. Your body responds as if overheating, triggering sweating to cool you down!",
        "Wrong. While eating does increase metabolism slightly, that's not why spicy food makes you sweat. The sweating is specifically triggered by capsaicin activating heat-sensing receptors, tricking your brain into thinking you need to cool down.",

        "Wrong. Many people drink coffee black without sugar. While sugar provides energy, it's not what keeps you awake. The alertness comes specifically from caffeine's effect on brain receptors, not from calories or sugar.",
        "Correct! Caffeine's molecular structure mimics adenosine, a neurotransmitter that builds up during the day and makes you sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain, preventing adenosine from binding and signaling tiredness. This keeps you alert! It takes about 30 minutes to peak and 3-5 hours to reduce by half.",
        "Wrong. You can drink iced coffee and still stay awake. Temperature doesn't affect alertness the way caffeine does. The stimulating effect is purely chemical - caffeine blocking sleep-promoting adenosine receptors in your brain.",

        "不对。很多人喝咖啡时不加糖，直接饮用黑咖啡。虽然糖分能提供能量，但它并非让人保持清醒的原因。警觉性主要来源于咖啡因对大脑受体的作用，而非热量或糖分。",
        "正确！咖啡因的分子结构类似于腺苷，这是一种在白天积累并使人感到困倦的神经递质。咖啡因会阻断大脑中的腺苷受体，阻止腺苷结合并传递疲劳信号，从而让你保持警觉！其效果约30分钟达到顶峰，3-5小时后减半。",
        "不对。你可以喝冰咖啡并保持清醒。温度不像咖啡因那样影响警觉性。提神效果纯粹是化学作用——咖啡因阻断了大脑中促进睡眠的腺苷受体。",
        "不对。虽然咖啡的香气宜人，或许能带来心理上的提振，但实际的清醒感来自于咖啡因化学性地阻断腺苷受体。即便没有香气，服用咖啡因药片也能达到同样的效果。"

        "Correct! Chocolate's main fat, cocoa butter, has a melting point of 34-38°C, just below human body temperature (37°C). When chocolate enters your mouth, body heat causes cocoa butter to melt, creating that smooth, creamy sensation. This unique melting property is why chocolate makers carefully control cocoa butter crystallization during tempering!",

        "Correct! As bananas ripen, cell walls break down releasing polyphenol oxidase enzyme. This enzyme reacts with phenolic compounds and oxygen, creating dark melanin pigments - the same process that browns apples! Ethylene gas produced by the banana accelerates ripening. Cold slows this enzyme activity, which is why refrigerated bananas stay yellow longer (though the skin still darkens).",

        "Wrong. While protein can be used for energy, that's not its primary role in muscle building. Carbohydrates and fats are preferred energy sources. Protein's special role is providing amino acids for tissue repair and growth.",
        "Correct! Proteins are made of amino acids. During exercise, muscle fibers get microscopic tears. Your body uses amino acids from dietary protein to repair and rebuild these fibers, making them stronger and larger. This process is called muscle protein synthesis. Essential amino acids (especially leucine) trigger this synthesis. That's why athletes need more protein - typically 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight!",
        "Wrong. While exercise increases blood flow, protein itself doesn't directly increase circulation. Protein helps muscles by providing amino acids needed to repair and build muscle tissue after exercise-induced damage.",
        "Wrong. This is a common myth - fat cannot turn into muscle. They're completely different tissues. Protein helps build muscle by providing amino acids for muscle protein synthesis. Fat loss and muscle gain are separate processes that can happen simultaneously with proper diet and exercise."

        "正确！蛋白质由氨基酸构成。运动时，肌纤维会出现微小撕裂。身体利用从膳食蛋白质中获取的氨基酸来修复和重建这些纤维，使其更强壮、更粗大。这个过程称为肌肉蛋白质合成。必需氨基酸（尤其是亮氨酸）会启动这一合成过程。这就是为什么运动员需要更多蛋白质——通常每公斤体重需要1.6至2.2克！",
        "错误。虽然运动能促进血液循环，但蛋白质本身并不直接增加循环。蛋白质通过提供氨基酸来帮助肌肉，这些氨基酸在运动引起的损伤后用于修复和构建肌肉组织。",
        "错误。这是一个常见的误解——脂肪无法转化为肌肉。它们是两种完全不同的组织。蛋白质通过提供氨基酸促进肌肉蛋白质合成，从而帮助增肌。减脂和增肌是两个独立的过程，在适当的饮食和锻炼下可以同时进行。"

        "Correct! Dietary fiber is plant material our bodies can't digest. Insoluble fiber (from wheat bran, vegetables) adds bulk to stool and speeds intestinal transit, preventing constipation. Soluble fiber (from oats, beans) absorbs water forming gel, slowing digestion and helping you feel full. Fiber also feeds beneficial gut bacteria, which produce healthy short-chain fatty acids!",

        "Wrong. While citrus fruits are high in vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin C contributes only slightly to sourness. The main sour taste comes from citric acid, which is present in much higher concentrations than vitamin C.",
        "Correct! Citrus fruits contain high levels of citric acid (typically 5-8% in lemons). When you eat them, citric acid molecules release hydrogen ions (H+), lowering pH. Your tongue's sour taste receptors detect these hydrogen ions and signal 'sour' to your brain. Citric acid also acts as a natural preservative and antioxidant. Ripe citrus still tastes sour even with high sugar because acid dominates!",
        "Wrong. While unripe fruits are more sour due to less sugar, even ripe citrus fruits taste sour because they naturally contain high citric acid levels. The sourness comes from acid, not just lack of sugar. Oranges have both sugar and acid.",

        "Wrong. Freezing doesn't kill most bacteria - it just makes them dormant. When food thaws, bacteria can become active again. That's why you shouldn't refreeze thawed food - bacteria may have multiplied during thawing.",
        "Correct! Freezing preserves food by dramatically slowing down two things: microbial growth and enzyme activity. At freezing temperatures, water becomes ice, making it unavailable for chemical reactions and bacterial metabolism. Enzymes that cause food degradation become nearly inactive. Bacteria don't die but can't reproduce or cause spoilage. Below -18°C, food stays safe almost indefinitely, though quality may decline!",
        "Wrong. Freezing doesn't remove moisture - it converts water to ice crystals. The water is still there, just in solid form. Freeze-drying is different and does remove moisture, but regular freezing preserves by making water unavailable for microbial and enzymatic activity.",

        "不对。虽然确实会结冰，但保护作用并非来自一层覆盖物。保存的原因在于水冻结成冰后，整个食物中的水分无法被微生物利用和参与酶促反应，而不仅限于表面。"
