        "Wrong. While cats do purr when happy, they also purr when scared, hurt, or giving birth. Purring serves multiple purposes beyond just expressing happiness.",
        "Correct! Cats purr for many reasons: comfort, healing, and self-soothing. The vibrations (25-150 Hz) may help heal bones and reduce pain. Mother cats purr to calm kittens, and injured cats purr to self-soothe. It's a multi-purpose comfort tool!",
        "Wrong. While mother cats do use purring to communicate with kittens, it's not specifically to call them. Cats use different vocalizations like meowing or chirping to call their young.",
        "Wrong. Purring is not caused by breathing through the nose. It's produced by rapid vibration of muscles in the larynx (voice box), causing the vocal cords to vibrate as the cat breathes in and out."

        "错误。虽然猫在高兴时会发出呼噜声，但它们在害怕、受伤或分娩时也会这样。呼噜声除了表达快乐外，还有多种用途。",
        "没错！猫发出呼噜声有多种原因：舒适、疗愈和自我安抚。这种振动（25-150赫兹）可能有助于骨骼愈合和减轻疼痛。母猫通过呼噜声安抚幼猫，受伤的猫则以此自我安慰。这真是一种多功能的舒适工具！",
        "错误。虽然母猫确实会用呼噜声与小猫交流，但这并非专门用来呼唤它们。猫会使用不同的叫声，如喵喵声或啁啾声，来呼唤幼崽。",
        "不对。呼噜声并非由鼻子呼吸引起，而是喉部肌肉快速振动所致，这种振动使猫在吸气和呼气时声带随之颤动。"

        "Correct! Tail wagging shows various emotions. A relaxed, wide wag means friendly. Fast, stiff wagging can mean arousal or aggression. Direction matters: wagging right often shows positive feelings, left shows negative. It's body language we can read to understand their mood!",

Some Arctic birds even migrate to Antarctica, following summer and food! This journey requires enormous energy but ensures survival.",

        "正确！鸟类迁徙主要是为了追随季节性的食物来源。冬季，寒冷地区的昆虫和植物变得稀少。鸟类飞往食物丰富的温暖地带。有些北极鸟类甚至会迁徙到南极洲，追逐夏季和食物！这段旅程需要消耗巨大能量，但确保了它们的生存。",

Special vertebrae, blood vessel adaptations, and flexible neck structures prevent injury during these extreme rotations.",

A special leg-locking mechanism (stay apparatus) lets them doze standing without tiring. However, they MUST lie down for deep REM sleep (2-3 hours daily) or they become sleep-deprived. It's a survival balance!",
