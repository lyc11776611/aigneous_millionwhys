        "Wrong. While cats do purr when happy, they also purr when scared, hurt, or giving birth. Purring serves multiple purposes beyond just expressing happiness.",
        "Correct! Cats purr for many reasons: comfort, healing, and self-soothing. The vibrations (25-150 Hz) may help heal bones and reduce pain. Mother cats purr to calm kittens, and injured cats purr to self-soothe. It's a multi-purpose comfort tool!",
        "Wrong. While mother cats do use purring to communicate with kittens, it's not specifically to call them. Cats use different vocalizations like meowing or chirping to call their young.",
        "Wrong. Purring is not caused by breathing through the nose. It's produced by rapid vibration of muscles in the larynx (voice box), causing the vocal cords to vibrate as the cat breathes in and out."

Some Arctic birds even migrate to Antarctica, following summer and food! This journey requires enormous energy but ensures survival.",

        "Correct! Horses evolved as prey animals on open plains. Standing sleep allows instant flight from predators. A special leg-locking mechanism (stay apparatus) lets them doze standing without tiring. However, they MUST lie down for deep REM sleep (2-3 hours daily) or they become sleep-deprived. It's a survival balance!",
