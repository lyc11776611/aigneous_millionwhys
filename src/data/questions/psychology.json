        "Wrong. Brain processing doesn't slow down in a way that makes time feel faster. The perception change is due to proportional time and fewer novel experiences, not processing speed.",
        "Correct! At age 5, one year is 20% of your life. At 50, it's only 2%. Also, children experience many 'firsts' that create detailed memories, making time feel longer. Adults have routine lives with fewer novel experiences, so our brains encode less detail and time seems to fly.",
        "Wrong. We don't have fewer memories as we age - we actually accumulate more total memories. The issue is that routine adult life creates fewer distinctive, detailed memories than childhood's many novel experiences.",
        "Wrong. Sleep changes don't explain the perception of time speeding up. It's about each year being a smaller fraction of your total life and having fewer novel experiences that create detailed memories."

        "错误。我们年纪越大，记忆并没有变少——实际上总记忆在积累。问题是成年人规律生活产生的独特详细记忆比童年少。",
        "错误。睡眠变化不能解释时间变快的感觉。关键在于每一年占生命总比例变小，以及新奇体验减少导致详细记忆减少。"

        "Wrong. This is a common misconception. Research shows blood oxygen levels don't change significantly with yawning. The current theory focuses on brain temperature regulation.",
        "Correct! Recent research suggests yawning helps cool your brain. When tired, your brain heats up slightly. Yawning brings cool air into your nasal and oral cavities, which cools blood going to the brain. This helps keep your brain at optimal temperature for functioning. That's why yawning often happens when drowsy or in warm rooms.",

It's an evolutionary survival mechanism that ensures caregivers respond quickly to their needs. As babies develop language and motor skills, crying decreases significantly.",

        "Wrong. The brain doesn't actively delete memories like a computer. Instead, memory traces become weaker when neural pathways aren't reinforced through retrieval and use.",
        "Correct! Forgetting follows the 'use it or lose it' principle. When we don't recall a memory, the neural connections that store it weaken over time through a process called memory decay. Our brains also constantly form new memories, which can interfere with old ones (interference theory). Additionally, we may fail to encode memories properly initially if we weren't paying attention, making them 'forgotten' even though they were never truly stored.",
        "Wrong. While we do store vast amounts of information, the quantity alone doesn't cause forgetting. The issue is the weakening of unused neural pathways and interference from new memories, not storage capacity.",

        "错误。虽然我们存储大量信息，但数量本身不会导致遗忘。问题在于未使用的神经通路变弱和新记忆的干扰，而不是存储容量。",

        "Wrong. While tickling does trigger a heightened response from the somatosensory cortex (detecting unexpected touch), the laughter isn't panic. It's a social bonding behavior indicating playful interaction.",
        "Correct! When someone tickles you, your brain's prefrontal cortex interprets the unexpected touch as playful social interaction, triggering laughter as a bonding response. Interestingly, you can't tickle yourself because your cerebellum predicts your own touch, eliminating the surprise element. Tickle laughter evolved as a way for humans to signal play and build social bonds, which is why it happens most between people who know each other.",

        "Wrong. Remembering negative events better isn't about personality pessimism. It's an evolved cognitive bias present in most humans, regardless of their general outlook on life.",
        "Correct! This is called 'negativity bias' - a survival mechanism evolved over millions of years. Our ancestors who remembered dangerous or negative experiences (where predators hide, which foods are poisonous) survived better than those who forgot them. The amygdala, our brain's threat-detection center, strongly encodes negative emotional experiences, making them stick better in memory. One bad experience could mean death, while missing one good opportunity rarely did.",
        "Wrong. It's not that positive memories decay faster - both types decay similarly over time. The difference is in initial encoding strength: negative events trigger stronger emotional arousal and amygdala activation, creating deeper memory traces from the start.",

        "Wrong. While we do make rapid judgments (in seconds), this doesn't explain why those first impressions are so hard to change. The real reason involves how our memory and cognitive biases work.",
        "Correct! First impressions matter due to the 'primacy effect' - information encountered first has disproportionate influence on our overall judgment. Our brains use initial information to create a schema (mental framework) about a person. Later information gets filtered through this existing schema via confirmation bias - we notice and remember things that confirm our first impression while dismissing contradictory evidence. This happens because changing existing schemas requires more cognitive effort than maintaining them.",
        "Wrong. Social etiquette doesn't cause the psychological stickiness of first impressions. The effect comes from cognitive mechanisms like primacy effect and confirmation bias, not social conventions.",

        "错误。虽然我们确实会在几秒内快速评判他人，但这无法解释为何第一印象难以改变。真正原因涉及记忆和认知偏差的作用。",
        "正确！第一印象之所以重要，是因为'首因效应'——最先接触的信息对我们整体判断影响巨大。大脑会用初始信息构建关于他人的心理框架（图式），后续信息会通过确认偏差被过滤：我们更容易注意和记住符合第一印象的证据，而忽略矛盾信息。这是因为改变现有图式比维持它需要更多认知努力。",

Our limbic system (emotional brain) strongly values immediate rewards and avoiding current discomfort, while our prefrontal cortex (planning brain) tries to consider future benefits. When facing an unpleasant task, the limbic system wins: the immediate relief from NOT doing the task feels better than the abstract future reward of completion. Our brain literally values future rewards less than immediate ones - a psychological phenomenon called hyperbolic discounting.",

Red increases arousal because it signals ripe fruit, blood, and danger - our ancestors needed heightened alertness around red. Yellow (sunlight) energizes us.

        "Correct! Music activates the brain's reward system through dopamine release, particularly in the nucleus accumbens. The key is 'reward prediction' - music creates expectations (based on patterns) and then either fulfills or violates them in interesting ways. When a song builds tension and releases it, or when we anticipate a familiar chorus, our brain releases dopamine. This is the same chemical involved in food, sex, and other pleasures. Music also engages multiple brain regions simultaneously (auditory cortex, motor cortex, emotional centers), creating a rich, pleasurable experience.",

When you perceive an exam as threatening to your social standing or future, your amygdala triggers the release of stress hormones - cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones increase heart rate, redirect blood to muscles, sharpen focus, and create that 'butterflies' feeling. This response evolved to help our ancestors escape physical danger. Your brain can't distinguish between 'exam threat' and 'predator threat,' so it activates the same ancient survival system - even though you can't fight or flee from an exam!",

When you perform a sequence (cue → routine → reward) repeatedly, the basal ganglia encodes it as a single unit, freeing your prefrontal cortex for other tasks.
