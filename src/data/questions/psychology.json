        "Wrong. Brain processing doesn't slow down in a way that makes time feel faster. The perception change is due to proportional time and fewer novel experiences, not processing speed.",
        "Correct! At age 5, one year is 20% of your life. At 50, it's only 2%. Also, children experience many 'firsts' that create detailed memories, making time feel longer. Adults have routine lives with fewer novel experiences, so our brains encode less detail and time seems to fly.",
        "Wrong. We don't have fewer memories as we age - we actually accumulate more total memories. The issue is that routine adult life creates fewer distinctive, detailed memories than childhood's many novel experiences.",

        "Correct! Recent research suggests yawning helps cool your brain. When tired, your brain heats up slightly. Yawning brings cool air into your nasal and oral cavities, which cools blood going to the brain. This helps keep your brain at optimal temperature for functioning. That's why yawning often happens when drowsy or in warm rooms.",

        "Wrong. The brain doesn't actively delete memories like a computer. Instead, memory traces become weaker when neural pathways aren't reinforced through retrieval and use.",
        "Correct! Forgetting follows the 'use it or lose it' principle. When we don't recall a memory, the neural connections that store it weaken over time through a process called memory decay. Our brains also constantly form new memories, which can interfere with old ones (interference theory). Additionally, we may fail to encode memories properly initially if we weren't paying attention, making them 'forgotten' even though they were never truly stored.",
        "Wrong. While we do store vast amounts of information, the quantity alone doesn't cause forgetting. The issue is the weakening of unused neural pathways and interference from new memories, not storage capacity.",

        "错误。大脑不像电脑那样主动删除记忆。相反，当神经通路没有通过提取和使用得到加强时，记忆痕迹会变弱。",

        "错误。虽然我们确实存储大量信息，但数量本身不会导致遗忘。问题在于未使用的神经通路减弱和新记忆的干扰，而不是存储容量。",

        "Wrong. While tickling does trigger a heightened response from the somatosensory cortex (detecting unexpected touch), the laughter isn't panic. It's a social bonding behavior indicating playful interaction.",
        "Correct! When someone tickles you, your brain's prefrontal cortex interprets the unexpected touch as playful social interaction, triggering laughter as a bonding response. Interestingly, you can't tickle yourself because your cerebellum predicts your own touch, eliminating the surprise element. Tickle laughter evolved as a way for humans to signal play and build social bonds, which is why it happens most between people who know each other.",

        "正确！当有人挠你痒时，大脑前额叶皮层将意外触摸解读为玩耍性社交互动，触发笑声作为联结反应。有趣的是，你无法自己挠自己痒，因为小脑会预测自己的触摸，消除了惊喜元素。挠痒痒的笑声进化为人类传递玩耍信号和建立社交联系的方式，这就是为什么它最常发生在熟人之间。",

        "Wrong. Remembering negative events better isn't about personality pessimism. It's an evolved cognitive bias present in most humans, regardless of their general outlook on life.",
        "Correct! This is called 'negativity bias' - a survival mechanism evolved over millions of years. Our ancestors who remembered dangerous or negative experiences (where predators hide, which foods are poisonous) survived better than those who forgot them. The amygdala, our brain's threat-detection center, strongly encodes negative emotional experiences, making them stick better in memory. One bad experience could mean death, while missing one good opportunity rarely did.",
        "Wrong. It's not that positive memories decay faster - both types decay similarly over time. The difference is in initial encoding strength: negative events trigger stronger emotional arousal and amygdala activation, creating deeper memory traces from the start.",

        "Correct! First impressions matter due to the 'primacy effect' - information encountered first has disproportionate influence on our overall judgment. Our brains use initial information to create a schema (mental framework) about a person. Later information gets filtered through this existing schema via confirmation bias - we notice and remember things that confirm our first impression while dismissing contradictory evidence. This happens because changing existing schemas requires more cognitive effort than maintaining them.",

Our limbic system (emotional brain) strongly values immediate rewards and avoiding current discomfort, while our prefrontal cortex (planning brain) tries to consider future benefits.

Red increases arousal because it signals ripe fruit, blood, and danger - our ancestors needed heightened alertness around red. Yellow (sunlight) energizes us.

        "Correct! Music activates the brain's reward system through dopamine release, particularly in the nucleus accumbens. The key is 'reward prediction' - music creates expectations (based on patterns) and then either fulfills or violates them in interesting ways. When a song builds tension and releases it, or when we anticipate a familiar chorus, our brain releases dopamine. This is the same chemical involved in food, sex, and other pleasures. Music also engages multiple brain regions simultaneously (auditory cortex, motor cortex, emotional centers), creating a rich, pleasurable experience.",

When you perceive an exam as threatening to your social standing or future, your amygdala triggers the release of stress hormones - cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones increase heart rate, redirect blood to muscles, sharpen focus, and create that 'butterflies' feeling. This response evolved to help our ancestors escape physical danger. Your brain can't distinguish between 'exam threat' and 'predator threat,' so it activates the same ancient survival system - even though you can't fight or flee from an exam!",

When you perform a sequence (cue → routine → reward) repeatedly, the basal ganglia encodes it as a single unit, freeing your prefrontal cortex for other tasks.

Neurologically, the behavior pathway gets myelinated (insulated), making signals travel faster and more efficiently.

Additionally, active learning triggers deeper cognitive processing and error correction, which strengthens neural connections more than passive observation.",
