        "Wrong. Brain processing doesn't slow down in a way that makes time feel faster. The perception change is due to proportional time and fewer novel experiences, not processing speed.",
        "Correct! At age 5, one year is 20% of your life. At 50, it's only 2%. Also, children experience many 'firsts' that create detailed memories, making time feel longer. Adults have routine lives with fewer novel experiences, so our brains encode less detail and time seems to fly.",
        "Wrong. We don't have fewer memories as we age - we actually accumulate more total memories. The issue is that routine adult life creates fewer distinctive, detailed memories than childhood's many novel experiences.",
        "Wrong. Sleep changes don't explain the perception of time speeding up. It's about each year being a smaller fraction of your total life and having fewer novel experiences that create detailed memories."

        "错误。随着年龄增长，我们的记忆并未减少——实际上我们积累了更多记忆。问题在于，成年后的规律生活产生的独特而细致的记忆，远少于童年时期诸多新奇经历所形成的记忆。",
        "不对。睡眠变化并不能解释为何感觉时间变快。真正的原因在于每一年在你生命中所占的比例越来越小，以及能创造详细记忆的新奇经历越来越少。"

        "Wrong. This is a common misconception. Research shows blood oxygen levels don't change significantly with yawning. The current theory focuses on brain temperature regulation.",
        "Correct! Recent research suggests yawning helps cool your brain. When tired, your brain heats up slightly. Yawning brings cool air into your nasal and oral cavities, which cools blood going to the brain. This helps keep your brain at optimal temperature for functioning. That's why yawning often happens when drowsy or in warm rooms.",

It's an evolutionary survival mechanism that ensures caregivers respond quickly to their needs. As babies develop language and motor skills, crying decreases significantly.",

        "Wrong. The brain doesn't actively delete memories like a computer. Instead, memory traces become weaker when neural pathways aren't reinforced through retrieval and use.",
        "Correct! Forgetting follows the 'use it or lose it' principle. When we don't recall a memory, the neural connections that store it weaken over time through a process called memory decay. Our brains also constantly form new memories, which can interfere with old ones (interference theory). Additionally, we may fail to encode memories properly initially if we weren't paying attention, making them 'forgotten' even though they were never truly stored.",
        "Wrong. While we do store vast amounts of information, the quantity alone doesn't cause forgetting. The issue is the weakening of unused neural pathways and interference from new memories, not storage capacity.",

        "错误。大脑并不会像电脑那样主动删除记忆。相反，当神经通路因未被回忆和使用而得不到强化时，记忆痕迹会逐渐减弱。",
        "正确！遗忘遵循“用进废退”的原则。当我们不去回忆某个记忆时，存储它的神经连接会随着时间逐渐减弱，这一过程称为记忆衰退。同时，我们的大脑不断形成新的记忆，这些新记忆可能会干扰旧的记忆（干扰理论）。此外，如果我们最初没有集中注意力，可能就无法正确编码记忆，导致它们即使从未真正被存储，也会被“遗忘”。",
        "错误。虽然我们确实储存了大量信息，但仅凭数量并不会导致遗忘。问题在于未使用的神经通路会减弱以及新记忆的干扰，而非存储容量。",

        "Wrong. Tickling doesn't hurt - it creates a unique sensation that's different from pain. The laughter response is social, not a pain reaction.",
        "Wrong. While tickling does trigger a heightened response from the somatosensory cortex (detecting unexpected touch), the laughter isn't panic. It's a social bonding behavior indicating playful interaction.",
        "Correct! When someone tickles you, your brain's prefrontal cortex interprets the unexpected touch as playful social interaction, triggering laughter as a bonding response. Interestingly, you can't tickle yourself because your cerebellum predicts your own touch, eliminating the surprise element. Tickle laughter evolved as a way for humans to signal play and build social bonds, which is why it happens most between people who know each other.",

        "没错！当有人挠你痒痒时，大脑前额叶皮层会将这种突如其来的触碰解读为嬉戏性的社交互动，从而引发笑声作为建立联系的回应。有趣的是，你无法给自己挠痒痒，因为小脑能预判自身的触碰，消除了意外因素。挠痒发笑是人类进化出的传递嬉戏信号、加强社会纽带的方式，因此这种现象在熟人之间最为常见。",

        "Correct! This is called 'negativity bias' - a survival mechanism evolved over millions of years. Our ancestors who remembered dangerous or negative experiences (where predators hide, which foods are poisonous) survived better than those who forgot them. The amygdala, our brain's threat-detection center, strongly encodes negative emotional experiences, making them stick better in memory. One bad experience could mean death, while missing one good opportunity rarely did.",
        "Wrong. It's not that positive memories decay faster - both types decay similarly over time. The difference is in initial encoding strength: negative events trigger stronger emotional arousal and amygdala activation, creating deeper memory traces from the start.",

        "Correct! First impressions matter due to the 'primacy effect' - information encountered first has disproportionate influence on our overall judgment. Our brains use initial information to create a schema (mental framework) about a person. Later information gets filtered through this existing schema via confirmation bias - we notice and remember things that confirm our first impression while dismissing contradictory evidence. This happens because changing existing schemas requires more cognitive effort than maintaining them.",

        "错误。虽然我们确实会在几秒钟内做出快速判断，但这并不能解释为何第一印象如此难以改变。真正的原因在于我们的记忆和认知偏见如何运作。",
        "正确！第一印象之所以重要，是因为“首因效应”——最先接触到的信息会对我们的整体判断产生不成比例的影响。我们的大脑会利用初始信息构建关于一个人的图式（心理框架）。后续信息会通过确认偏误被这个既有图式过滤——我们倾向于注意并记住那些印证第一印象的内容，同时忽略相悖的证据。这是因为改变现有图式比维持它们需要更多的认知努力。",

Our limbic system (emotional brain) strongly values immediate rewards and avoiding current discomfort, while our prefrontal cortex (planning brain) tries to consider future benefits. When facing an unpleasant task, the limbic system wins: the immediate relief from NOT doing the task feels better than the abstract future reward of completion. Our brain literally values future rewards less than immediate ones - a psychological phenomenon called hyperbolic discounting.",

Red increases arousal because it signals ripe fruit, blood, and danger - our ancestors needed heightened alertness around red. Yellow (sunlight) energizes us.

        "Wrong. Music isn't universally pleasant - different people like different types. This doesn't explain the neurological mechanism of why music feels good when we do like it.",
        "Correct! Music activates the brain's reward system through dopamine release, particularly in the nucleus accumbens. The key is 'reward prediction' - music creates expectations (based on patterns) and then either fulfills or violates them in interesting ways. When a song builds tension and releases it, or when we anticipate a familiar chorus, our brain releases dopamine. This is the same chemical involved in food, sex, and other pleasures. Music also engages multiple brain regions simultaneously (auditory cortex, motor cortex, emotional centers), creating a rich, pleasurable experience.",
        "Wrong. While music does facilitate social bonding (think concerts, lullabies, group singing), this doesn't explain the neurological reward mechanism. The dopamine-based reward prediction system is why individual listening still feels good.",
        "Wrong. Pattern recognition is involved in how we process music, but it doesn't explain the pleasure. The reward comes from dopamine release triggered by how music plays with our predictions and expectations, not pattern recognition alone."

        "确实如此！音乐通过释放多巴胺激活大脑的奖励系统，尤其是在伏隔核区域。关键在于“奖励预测”——音乐基于模式创造期待，并以有趣的方式满足或打破这些期待。当歌曲营造紧张感后释放，或是我们预见到熟悉的副歌时，大脑便会释放多巴胺。这种化学物质同样存在于饮食、性行为等愉悦体验中。音乐还能同时调动多个脑区（听觉皮层、运动皮层、情绪中枢），创造出丰富而愉悦的感官体验。",
        "错误。虽然音乐确实能促进社交联系（如音乐会、摇篮曲、合唱活动），但这并不能解释神经奖励机制。基于多巴胺的奖励预测系统才是个人聆听音乐仍感愉悦的原因。",
        "错误。虽然模式识别参与了我们处理音乐的过程，但它并不能解释愉悦感的来源。快感源于音乐如何与我们的预测和期望互动所触发的多巴胺释放，而非仅仅模式识别本身。"

        "Correct! Exam nervousness is your fight-or-flight response activating. When you perceive an exam as threatening to your social standing or future, your amygdala triggers the release of stress hormones - cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones increase heart rate, redirect blood to muscles, sharpen focus, and create that 'butterflies' feeling. This response evolved to help our ancestors escape physical danger. Your brain can't distinguish between 'exam threat' and 'predator threat,' so it activates the same ancient survival system - even though you can't fight or flee from an exam!",

        "Correct! Habits form through the basal ganglia, which converts repeated behaviors into automatic routines via 'chunking.' When you perform a sequence (cue → routine → reward) repeatedly, the basal ganglia encodes it as a single unit, freeing your prefrontal cortex for other tasks. This creates a habit loop: the cue triggers the routine automatically without conscious decision-making. Neurologically, the behavior pathway gets myelinated (insulated), making signals travel faster and more efficiently. This automation was evolutionarily advantageous - imagine having to consciously think about walking!",

Disgust prevents us from eating spoiled food or touching contaminants. Anger prepares us to fight threats. Joy reinforces beneficial behaviors. Sadness signals loss and triggers support-seeking.
