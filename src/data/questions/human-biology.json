        "Wrong. While the stomach can send up air as burps, hiccups are caused by the diaphragm muscle below the lungs, not stomach activity.",
        "Correct! Hiccups happen when your diaphragm muscle suddenly contracts. This muscle sits below your lungs and controls breathing. When it spasms, you quickly suck in air and your vocal cords snap shut, making the 'hic' sound. Common triggers include eating too fast, carbonated drinks, or sudden temperature changes.",
        "Wrong. Hiccups aren't caused by lung expansion. They result from involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle that controls breathing.",

        "不对。虽然胃部会通过打嗝排出空气，但打嗝是由肺部下方的膈肌引起的，与胃部活动无关。",
        "没错！打嗝是因为膈肌突然收缩引起的。这块肌肉位于肺部下方，负责控制呼吸。当它发生痉挛时，你会快速吸入空气，同时声带猛然闭合，就发出了“嗝”的声音。常见诱因包括进食过快、饮用碳酸饮料或突然的温度变化。",
        "不对。打嗝并非由肺部扩张引起，而是由于控制呼吸的膈肌发生不自主收缩所致。",
        "不对。食物卡在喉咙会引起窒息或咳嗽，而不是打嗝。打嗝是由肺部下方的膈肌痉挛引起的。"

Your brain triggers a forceful expulsion of air at up to 100 mph to blast out irritants. This automatic defense keeps harmful particles from entering your lungs.",

        "Wrong. While having two eyes does provide backup, that's not the main evolutionary reason.",
        "Correct! Each eye sees from a slightly different angle. Your brain combines these views to create depth perception—judging how far away objects are. This stereoscopic vision was crucial for our ancestors hunting and avoiding predators!",
        "Wrong. Wider view is a benefit, but depth perception is the key advantage of two forward-facing eyes.",
        "Wrong. Color vision works the same with one or two eyes. Depth perception requires two viewpoints."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错误。虽然拥有两只眼睛确实提供了备用功能，但这并非主要的进化原因。",
        "没错！每只眼睛从略微不同的角度观察事物，大脑将这些视角合并以形成深度感知——判断物体的远近。这种立体视觉对我们的祖先在狩猎和躲避捕食者时至关重要！",
        "错误。视野更广确实是一个优点，但双眼朝前的关键在于深度感知能力。",
        "错误。无论单眼还是双眼，色觉原理相同。深度感知则需要双眼视角。"

        "Correct! Fluid in your inner ear detects rotation. When you stop spinning, the fluid keeps moving due to momentum. Your brain gets conflicting signals—ears say spinning, eyes say stopped. This mismatch causes dizziness!",
        "Wrong. Spinning doesn't significantly affect brain oxygen. The dizziness comes from inner ear signals.",

      "explanations_zh": [
        "正确！内耳中的液体负责感知旋转。当你停止转动时，由于惯性，液体仍在继续流动。大脑接收到相互矛盾的信号——耳朵说在转，眼睛说已停止。这种不匹配导致了头晕！",

        "不对。眼睛聚焦并非原因，内耳的平衡系统才是产生旋转感的关键。",

        "Correct! Joints contain fluid with dissolved gases. Stretching the joint lowers pressure, causing gases to form a bubble that quickly collapses—pop! You must wait for gas to redissolve before cracking again. Studies show it doesn't cause arthritis!",
