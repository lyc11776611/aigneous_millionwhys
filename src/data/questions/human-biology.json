        "Wrong. While the stomach can send up air as burps, hiccups are caused by the diaphragm muscle below the lungs, not stomach activity.",
        "Correct! Hiccups happen when your diaphragm muscle suddenly contracts. This muscle sits below your lungs and controls breathing. When it spasms, you quickly suck in air and your vocal cords snap shut, making the 'hic' sound. Common triggers include eating too fast, carbonated drinks, or sudden temperature changes.",
        "Wrong. Hiccups aren't caused by lung expansion. They result from involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle that controls breathing.",

        "错误。打嗝不是由肺部扩张引起的。它源于控制呼吸的横膈膜肌肉的非自主收缩。",

Your stomach may growl, but that's just movement, not emptiness. This system ensures your body gets energy before reserves run too low.",

        "Wrong. Sneezing isn't about releasing excess air. It's a protective reflex triggered by the nervous system when irritants are detected in the nasal passages.",
        "Correct! Sneezing is a powerful reflex that protects your respiratory system. When dust, pollen, or germs irritate your nose, nerve endings send signals to your brain. Your brain triggers a forceful expulsion of air at up to 100 mph to blast out irritants. This automatic defense keeps harmful particles from entering your lungs.",

Crying also activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms you down. It's a natural way your body processes intense emotions and signals others you need support.",

Your body repairs tissues, builds muscle, and strengthens the immune system. Growth hormone is released, and neurons form new connections.

When your stomach is empty, the contractions squeeze mostly air, creating louder rumbling sounds. Hormones like motilin trigger these contractions, especially when you're hungry.",

        "Wrong. Shivering doesn't serve as a warning signal. It's a thermoregulatory reflex where muscles rapidly contract to generate heat when body temperature drops.",
        "Correct! Shivering is your body's automatic response to cold, controlled by the hypothalamus. When body temperature drops, your brain triggers rapid muscle contractions. These involuntary movements burn energy and generate heat through friction and metabolic activity. Shivering can increase heat production by up to five times, helping maintain your core temperature at 98.6°F (37°C).",
        "Wrong. While cold does affect blood flow (vessels constrict to preserve core heat), shivering specifically works by rapid muscle contractions that generate heat through metabolic activity.",

        "Wrong. While sweat does contain small amounts of waste, its primary function isn't excretion. Sweating is a thermoregulatory mechanism that cools the body through evaporation.",
        "Correct! Sweating is your body's air conditioning system. When body temperature rises from exercise or heat, the hypothalamus activates sweat glands. They release water onto your skin surface. As this water evaporates, it absorbs heat energy from your body, cooling you down. You have 2-4 million sweat glands that can produce up to several liters per hour!",
