        "Wrong. While the stomach can send up air as burps, hiccups are caused by the diaphragm muscle below the lungs, not stomach activity.",
        "Correct! Hiccups happen when your diaphragm muscle suddenly contracts. This muscle sits below your lungs and controls breathing. When it spasms, you quickly suck in air and your vocal cords snap shut, making the 'hic' sound. Common triggers include eating too fast, carbonated drinks, or sudden temperature changes.",
        "Wrong. Hiccups aren't caused by lung expansion. They result from involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle that controls breathing.",

Your brain triggers a forceful expulsion of air at up to 100 mph to blast out irritants. This automatic defense keeps harmful particles from entering your lungs.",

Your heart rate can double or triple to meet these demands!",

        "Wrong. While having two eyes does provide backup, that's not the main evolutionary reason.",
        "Correct! Each eye sees from a slightly different angle. Your brain combines these views to create depth perception—judging how far away objects are. This stereoscopic vision was crucial for our ancestors hunting and avoiding predators!",
        "Wrong. Wider view is a benefit, but depth perception is the key advantage of two forward-facing eyes.",

        "Correct! Fluid in your inner ear detects rotation. When you stop spinning, the fluid keeps moving due to momentum. Your brain gets conflicting signals—ears say spinning, eyes say stopped. This mismatch causes dizziness!",
