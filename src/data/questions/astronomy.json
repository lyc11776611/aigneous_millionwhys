        "Wrong. The Moon does rotate on its axis. If it didn't rotate at all, we would eventually see all sides of it as it orbits Earth.",
        "Correct! This is called 'tidal locking.' The Moon rotates, but takes the same time (27.3 days) to spin once as it does to orbit Earth. This happened over millions of years due to Earth's gravity. So the same side always faces us. The far side gets sunlight too, we just never see it from Earth.",
        "Wrong. Earth's gravity doesn't stop the Moon from rotating. Instead, gravity caused tidal locking over time, making the rotation period equal to the orbital period.",

        "Wrong. The amount of light reflected doesn't determine whether an object twinkles. Both bright and dim planets show steady light compared to stars.",
        "Correct! Stars appear as tiny points of light because they're so far away. Earth's atmosphere moves and bends this single point of light, making it twinkle. Planets are much closer, so they appear as small disks. Light from different parts of the disk averages out atmospheric distortion, creating steady light.",

        "正确！星星距离极远，看起来像微小的光点。地球大气层的流动会使这个光点产生弯曲，造成闪烁。而行星离我们近得多，呈现为小圆盘。来自圆盘不同部分的光线会平均掉大气扰动，因此看起来比较稳定。",

        "Wrong. While pollution can sometimes enhance sunset colors slightly, it's not the primary cause. Clean air produces beautiful sunsets too through natural light scattering.",
        "Correct! At sunset, sunlight travels through much more atmosphere to reach your eyes. Blue light scatters away first, leaving reds, oranges, and yellows. The thicker the atmosphere the light passes through, the more blue is removed, making sunsets appear warmer and more colorful than midday sky.",
        "Wrong. The Sun itself doesn't change color - it emits the same spectrum of light throughout the day. The apparent color change is due to atmospheric filtering.",
        "Wrong. While clouds can add to the beauty of sunsets by reflecting the colored light, they don't create the colors. The warm hues come from atmospheric scattering of sunlight."

        "错误。虽然污染有时会略微增强日落颜色，但这不是主要原因。清洁空气通过自然光散射也能产生美丽的日落。",
        "正确！日落时，阳光需要穿过更多的大气层才能到达我们的眼睛。蓝光首先被散射掉，留下红色、橙色和黄色。光线穿过的大气层越厚，蓝光被过滤得越多，所以日落比正午的天空更温暖、更多彩。",
        "错误。太阳本身不会改变颜色——它全天发出相同光谱的光。表观颜色变化是由于大气过滤造成的。",

        "Wrong. Earth's shadow only falls on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, which happens rarely. The regular monthly changes in the Moon's appearance are not caused by Earth's shadow.",
        "Correct! The Moon doesn't change shape - it's always a sphere. As the Moon orbits Earth (taking 29.5 days), we see different portions of its sunlit side. When the Moon is between Earth and Sun, we see mostly the dark side (new moon). When Earth is between them, we see the full sunlit side (full moon). The changing shapes are called phases.",
        "Wrong. The Moon rotates steadily, taking the same time to rotate as to orbit Earth (27.3 days). Irregular rotation wouldn't create the predictable monthly pattern of phases we observe.",
        "Wrong. Clouds can temporarily block our view of the Moon, but they don't cause the regular monthly cycle of phases. The Moon's phases occur even on perfectly clear nights and follow a precise 29.5-day schedule."

        "错误。地球的影子只在月食期间落在月球上，这种情况很少发生。月球每月规律性的外观变化不是由地球影子造成的。",

For about half the month, the Moon is in the daytime sky. It's bright enough (reflecting sunlight) to be visible even when the sky is lit up, especially when not too close to the Sun's glare.",

        "Correct! Earth's axis is tilted 23.5° from vertical. As Earth orbits the Sun, this tilt means the Northern Hemisphere points toward the Sun in June (summer there) and away in December (winter). When tilted toward the Sun, that hemisphere gets more direct sunlight and longer days, creating summer. The opposite hemisphere experiences winter. This tilt causes seasons.",
        "Wrong. The Sun's energy output is remarkably constant over short timescales like years. Small variations (about 0.1%) follow an 11-year solar cycle, but this doesn't cause our annual seasons.",

        "正确！地球自转轴相对于垂直方向倾斜23.5°。当地球绕太阳公转时，这种倾斜意味着北半球在6月指向太阳（那里是夏季），在12月背向太阳（冬季）。当倾向太阳时，该半球获得更直接的阳光和更长的白天，形成夏季。相反的半球则经历冬季。这种倾斜造成了季节。",

Light from stars spreads out in all directions, getting dimmer with distance. Most light from distant stars is too faint to see. Also, the universe has a finite age (13.8 billion years), so we can't see infinitely distant stars. The vast emptiness makes space appear dark.",

        "Correct! We move with Earth at the same constant speed, so there's no relative motion to feel. It's like being in a smoothly cruising airplane - you don't feel the 500 mph speed because you, the plane, and the air inside all move together. Earth's rotation is so smooth and constant that everything moves together. We only feel changes in speed or direction (acceleration), not constant motion.",

        "Wrong. The atmosphere rotates with Earth at the same speed we do, but this isn't what prevents us from feeling the spin. We don't feel motion because we're moving at a constant velocity with Earth. If Earth suddenly stopped spinning, we'd definitely feel it!"

Lunar eclipse: Earth passes between Sun and Moon, and Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. This only happens at full moon. We don't get eclipses every month because the Moon's orbit is tilted 5° to Earth's orbit, so alignment is rare.",
