        "Wrong. The Moon does rotate on its axis. If it didn't rotate at all, we would eventually see all sides of it as it orbits Earth.",
        "Correct! This is called 'tidal locking.' The Moon rotates, but takes the same time (27.3 days) to spin once as it does to orbit Earth. This happened over millions of years due to Earth's gravity. So the same side always faces us. The far side gets sunlight too, we just never see it from Earth.",
        "Wrong. Earth's gravity doesn't stop the Moon from rotating. Instead, gravity caused tidal locking over time, making the rotation period equal to the orbital period.",
        "Wrong. The far side of the Moon receives sunlight just like the near side. It's not permanently dark - we just can't see it from Earth due to tidal locking."

        "错误。地球引力没有阻止月球自转，而是通过潮汐锁定让自转和公转周期变得一致。",

        "Wrong. The amount of light reflected doesn't determine whether an object twinkles. Both bright and dim planets show steady light compared to stars.",
        "Correct! Stars appear as tiny points of light because they're so far away. Earth's atmosphere moves and bends this single point of light, making it twinkle. Planets are much closer, so they appear as small disks. Light from different parts of the disk averages out atmospheric distortion, creating steady light.",

        "Wrong. While pollution can sometimes enhance sunset colors slightly, it's not the primary cause. Clean air produces beautiful sunsets too through natural light scattering.",
        "Correct! At sunset, sunlight travels through much more atmosphere to reach your eyes. Blue light scatters away first, leaving reds, oranges, and yellows. The thicker the atmosphere the light passes through, the more blue is removed, making sunsets appear warmer and more colorful than midday sky.",
        "Wrong. The Sun itself doesn't change color - it emits the same spectrum of light throughout the day. The apparent color change is due to atmospheric filtering.",
        "Wrong. While clouds can add to the beauty of sunsets by reflecting the colored light, they don't create the colors. The warm hues come from atmospheric scattering of sunlight."

        "错误。虽然污染有时会让日落颜色更浓一点，但这不是主要原因。干净的空气通过自然的光线散射也能产生美丽的日落。",
        "正确！日落时，阳光要穿过更厚的大气层才能到达你的眼睛。蓝光最先被散射掉，留下红、橙、黄色。光线穿过的大气层越厚，蓝光被移除得越多，所以日落比正午的天空更温暖多彩。",
        "错误。太阳本身不会变色——它全天都发出相同的光谱。看起来的颜色变化是因为大气过滤造成的。",

        "Wrong. Earth's shadow only falls on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, which happens rarely. The regular monthly changes in the Moon's appearance are not caused by Earth's shadow.",
        "Correct! The Moon doesn't change shape - it's always a sphere. As the Moon orbits Earth (taking 29.5 days), we see different portions of its sunlit side. When the Moon is between Earth and Sun, we see mostly the dark side (new moon). When Earth is between them, we see the full sunlit side (full moon). The changing shapes are called phases.",
        "Wrong. The Moon rotates steadily, taking the same time to rotate as to orbit Earth (27.3 days). Irregular rotation wouldn't create the predictable monthly pattern of phases we observe.",
        "Wrong. Clouds can temporarily block our view of the Moon, but they don't cause the regular monthly cycle of phases. The Moon's phases occur even on perfectly clear nights and follow a precise 29.5-day schedule."

      "explanations_zh": [
        "错啦！地球的影子只在月食时落在月亮上，这很少发生。月亮每月规律的形状变化不是由地球影子引起的。",
        "正确！月亮其实没变形状——它一直是个球体。月亮绕地球转一圈要29.5天，我们看到它被太阳照亮的部分不同。当月亮在地球和太阳之间时，我们大多看到暗面（新月）；当地球在中间时，我们看到整个亮面（满月）。这些变化就叫月相。",
        "不对哦。月亮自转很稳定，自转一圈和绕地球一圈时间相同（27.3天）。不规则自转不会产生我们观察到的可预测的月相模式。",

        "Correct! The Moon orbits Earth, not the Sun, so it can be anywhere in its orbit - sometimes on the night side, sometimes the day side. For about half the month, the Moon is in the daytime sky. It's bright enough (reflecting sunlight) to be visible even when the sky is lit up, especially when not too close to the Sun's glare.",
        "Wrong. Air clarity doesn't determine when the Moon is visible. The Moon's visibility depends on its position in orbit around Earth and whether it's reflecting enough sunlight to be seen against the bright daytime sky.",

        "Correct! Earth's axis is tilted 23.5° from vertical. As Earth orbits the Sun, this tilt means the Northern Hemisphere points toward the Sun in June (summer there) and away in December (winter). When tilted toward the Sun, that hemisphere gets more direct sunlight and longer days, creating summer. The opposite hemisphere experiences winter. This tilt causes seasons.",
        "Wrong. The Sun's energy output is remarkably constant over short timescales like years. Small variations (about 0.1%) follow an 11-year solar cycle, but this doesn't cause our annual seasons.",
        "Wrong. While Earth's orbital speed does vary slightly (faster when closer to the Sun), this small variation doesn't cause seasons. The 23.5° axial tilt is responsible for the dramatic seasonal temperature and daylight changes we experience."

        "正确！地球的轴倾斜23.5度。当地球绕太阳公转时，这个倾斜导致北半球在6月朝向太阳（夏季），12月远离（冬季）。朝向太阳时，该半球获得更多直射阳光和更长白昼，形成夏季；相反半球则经历冬季。这个倾斜是四季的原因。",
        "错误。太阳的能量输出在短时间如几年内非常稳定。微小变化（约0.1%）遵循11年太阳周期，但这不会导致我们每年的四季。",

Light from stars spreads out in all directions, getting dimmer with distance. Most light from distant stars is too faint to see. Also, the universe has a finite age (13.8 billion years), so we can't see infinitely distant stars. The vast emptiness makes space appear dark.",

        "Correct! We move with Earth at the same constant speed, so there's no relative motion to feel. It's like being in a smoothly cruising airplane - you don't feel the 500 mph speed because you, the plane, and the air inside all move together. Earth's rotation is so smooth and constant that everything moves together. We only feel changes in speed or direction (acceleration), not constant motion.",

        "Correct! A year is defined by how long Earth takes to complete one full orbit around the Sun - approximately 365.25 days. This is determined by Earth's orbital distance (93 million miles) and speed (67,000 mph). We round to 365 days for convenience, adding a leap day every 4 years to account for the extra 0.25 days.

Billions of years ago, iron in Mars' rocks reacted with oxygen and water, creating a rusty dust that covers much of the planet's surface. This reddish-brown dust gives Mars its distinctive red appearance. Strong winds blow this dust around, coating everything and even creating the reddish sky we see in photos from Mars rovers.",

Lunar eclipse: Earth passes between Sun and Moon, and Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. This only happens at full moon. We don't get eclipses every month because the Moon's orbit is tilted 5° to Earth's orbit, so alignment is rare.",

The result is a balance: the planet's forward motion combined with inward gravitational pull creates a curved orbit.

The Sun is much closer (93 million miles vs. trillions of miles for other stars), so it appears millions of times brighter.
