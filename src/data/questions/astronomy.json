        "Wrong. The Moon does rotate on its axis. If it didn't rotate at all, we would eventually see all sides of it as it orbits Earth.",
        "Correct! This is called 'tidal locking.' The Moon rotates, but takes the same time (27.3 days) to spin once as it does to orbit Earth. This happened over millions of years due to Earth's gravity. So the same side always faces us. The far side gets sunlight too, we just never see it from Earth.",
        "Wrong. Earth's gravity doesn't stop the Moon from rotating. Instead, gravity caused tidal locking over time, making the rotation period equal to the orbital period.",

        "Wrong. While stars are indeed farther away, distance alone doesn't explain twinkling. The key is that distance makes stars appear as tiny points of light, which are more affected by atmospheric distortion.",
        "Wrong. The amount of light reflected doesn't determine whether an object twinkles. Both bright and dim planets show steady light compared to stars.",
        "Correct! Stars appear as tiny points of light because they're so far away. Earth's atmosphere moves and bends this single point of light, making it twinkle. Planets are much closer, so they appear as small disks. Light from different parts of the disk averages out atmospheric distortion, creating steady light.",

        "确实如此！星星之所以呈现为微小的光点，是因为它们距离我们极其遥远。地球大气层会使这些单一光点发生移动和弯曲，从而产生闪烁效果。行星则距离近得多，因此看起来像是小圆盘。来自圆盘不同部分的光线会平均掉大气造成的畸变，从而形成稳定的光芒。",

        "Wrong. While pollution can sometimes enhance sunset colors slightly, it's not the primary cause. Clean air produces beautiful sunsets too through natural light scattering.",
        "Correct! At sunset, sunlight travels through much more atmosphere to reach your eyes. Blue light scatters away first, leaving reds, oranges, and yellows. The thicker the atmosphere the light passes through, the more blue is removed, making sunsets appear warmer and more colorful than midday sky.",
        "Wrong. The Sun itself doesn't change color - it emits the same spectrum of light throughout the day. The apparent color change is due to atmospheric filtering.",
        "Wrong. While clouds can add to the beauty of sunsets by reflecting the colored light, they don't create the colors. The warm hues come from atmospheric scattering of sunlight."

        "错误。虽然污染有时会略微增强日落色彩，但这并非主要原因。洁净的空气通过自然光线散射同样能产生美丽的日落景象。",
        "没错！日落时分，阳光需穿越更厚的大气层才能抵达你的眼睛。蓝光最先散射消失，留下红、橙、黄等色调。光线穿透的大气层越厚，被过滤的蓝光就越多，因此日落时的天空会比正午时分更显温暖绚丽。",
        "不对。太阳本身并不会改变颜色——它在一天中发出的光谱是相同的。看起来颜色的变化是由于大气过滤造成的。",

        "Wrong. Earth's shadow only falls on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, which happens rarely. The regular monthly changes in the Moon's appearance are not caused by Earth's shadow.",
        "Correct! The Moon doesn't change shape - it's always a sphere. As the Moon orbits Earth (taking 29.5 days), we see different portions of its sunlit side. When the Moon is between Earth and Sun, we see mostly the dark side (new moon). When Earth is between them, we see the full sunlit side (full moon). The changing shapes are called phases.",
        "Wrong. The Moon rotates steadily, taking the same time to rotate as to orbit Earth (27.3 days). Irregular rotation wouldn't create the predictable monthly pattern of phases we observe.",
        "Wrong. Clouds can temporarily block our view of the Moon, but they don't cause the regular monthly cycle of phases. The Moon's phases occur even on perfectly clear nights and follow a precise 29.5-day schedule."

        "错误。地球的影子只有在月食期间才会落在月球上，而月食很少发生。月球外观的每月规律变化并非由地球的影子造成。",

        "错误。月球稳定自转，其自转周期与绕地球公转周期相同（27.3天）。不规律的自转不会形成我们观察到的可预测的月相周期模式。",
        "不对。云层可能会暂时遮挡我们看月亮的视线，但它们并不会导致月亮每月规律的相位变化。即使在完全晴朗的夜晚，月相依然会出现，并且遵循精确的29.5天周期。"

For about half the month, the Moon is in the daytime sky. It's bright enough (reflecting sunlight) to be visible even when the sky is lit up, especially when not too close to the Sun's glare.",

        "Correct! Earth's axis is tilted 23.5° from vertical. As Earth orbits the Sun, this tilt means the Northern Hemisphere points toward the Sun in June (summer there) and away in December (winter). When tilted toward the Sun, that hemisphere gets more direct sunlight and longer days, creating summer. The opposite hemisphere experiences winter. This tilt causes seasons.",
        "Wrong. The Sun's energy output is remarkably constant over short timescales like years. Small variations (about 0.1%) follow an 11-year solar cycle, but this doesn't cause our annual seasons.",

Light from stars spreads out in all directions, getting dimmer with distance. Most light from distant stars is too faint to see. Also, the universe has a finite age (13.8 billion years), so we can't see infinitely distant stars. The vast emptiness makes space appear dark.",

Billions of years ago, iron in Mars' rocks reacted with oxygen and water, creating a rusty dust that covers much of the planet's surface.

        "错误。虽然彗星确实移动得很快，但仅凭速度并不能产生尾巴。小行星移动速度同样快，却没有尾巴。尾巴的形成是因为靠近太阳时，太阳辐射和太阳风作用于彗星的冰和尘埃，而非速度所致。",
        "正确！彗星是由冰、尘埃和岩石构成的“脏雪球”。远离太阳时，它们处于冰冻状态且无尾迹。当接近太阳时，太阳热量使冰蒸发，释放出气体和尘埃。太阳辐射将尘埃颗粒推开，形成黄色的尘埃尾。太阳风（带电粒子）吹散气体，形成蓝色的离子尾。两条彗尾始终背向太阳方向延伸，而非顺着彗星运动轨迹。随着彗星远离太阳，它会再次冻结，彗尾也随之消失。",
        "错误。彗星确实会在其轨道上留下一些碎片（当地球穿过时引发流星雨），但这些散布的碎片并非我们所见的彗星尾巴。可见的尾巴是由太阳风和辐射从彗星上吹走的气体和尘埃，形成指向远离太阳方向的流束。",
        "错误。引力并不会将物质拉出形成彗尾——引力会将物质向内拉，而不是向外。彗尾的形成是因为太阳辐射压和太阳风（来自太阳的带电粒子流）将气体和尘埃从彗星推离，从而形成指向远离太阳方向的尾巴。"
