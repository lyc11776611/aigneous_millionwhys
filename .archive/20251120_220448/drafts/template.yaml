    question_zh: "为什么树懒动作这么慢？"
    correct_answer: 2
    choices_en:
      - "They are always tired"
      - "Their muscles are weak"
      - "Low metabolism saves energy"
      - "They move slowly to hide"
    choices_zh:
      - "它们总是很累"
      - "它们的肌肉很弱"
      - "低代谢节省能量"
      - "慢动作用于隐藏"

  # Example 3: Full content (skip AI generation)
  - question_en: "Why do fireflies glow?"
    question_zh: "萤火虫为什么会发光？"
    correct_answer: 0
    choices_en:
      - "Chemical reaction creates light"
      - "Reflect moonlight"
      - "Store sunlight during day"
      - "Electric charge in body"
    choices_zh:
      - "化学反应产生光"
      - "反射月光"
      - "白天储存阳光"
      - "体内电荷"
    explanations_en:
      - "Correct! Fireflies produce light through a chemical reaction called bioluminescence. A substance called luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme luciferase, producing light with almost no heat."
      - "Wrong. Fireflies don't reflect moonlight. They actively produce their own light through chemical reactions in special organs called lanterns located in their abdomen."
      - "Wrong. Fireflies don't store sunlight. They create light on demand through a chemical process that can be turned on and off by controlling oxygen flow to light-producing cells."
      - "Wrong. Firefly light is not produced by electricity. It's a biochemical process involving specific molecules and enzymes that convert chemical energy into light energy."
    explanations_zh:
      - "正确！萤火虫通过称为生物发光的化学反应产生光。一种叫萤光素的物质在萤光素酶的作用下与氧气反应，产生几乎无热的光。"
      - "错误。萤火虫不反射月光。它们在腹部的特殊器官中通过化学反应主动产生自己的光。"
      - "错误。萤火虫不储存阳光。它们通过控制氧气流向发光细胞，按需创造光的化学过程。"
      - "错误。萤火虫的光不是由电产生的。这是一个生化过程，涉及将化学能转化为光能的特定分子和酶。"
