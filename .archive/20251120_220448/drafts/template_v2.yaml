# Question Draft Template V2 - New Workflow
#
# NEW WORKFLOW:
# 1. Create questions in English (minimal required: question + choices)
# 2. Claude generates explanations and does fact-checking/self-correction
# 3. DeepSeek translates everything to Chinese
# 4. Timestamps added automatically (created_at, last_modified_at)
#
# NO OPENAI API USED - Only Claude (Anthropic) and DeepSeek

category: Animals  # Choose from: Animals, Astronomy, Chemistry, Economics, Human Biology, Physics, Plants, Psychology, Technology, Weather, Food & Nutrition, Earth Science

questions:
  # Example 1: MINIMAL INPUT (Recommended - let AI do the work)
  # Just provide English question and choices, AI handles everything else
  - question_en: "Why do octopuses have three hearts?"
    correct_answer: 1  # Index 0-3
    choices_en:
      - "To pump blood faster"
      - "Two pump blood to gills, one to body"
      - "Backup in case one fails"
      - "To control multiple tentacles"
    difficulty: hard  # easy, medium, or hard

  # What happens automatically:
  # ✅ Claude generates English explanations
  # ✅ Claude fact-checks and self-corrects
  # ✅ DeepSeek translates to Chinese (question, choices, explanations)
  # ✅ Timestamps added (created_at, last_modified_at)

  # Example 2: WITH EXPLANATIONS (if you want to write them yourself)
  - question_en: "Why do sloths move so slowly?"
    correct_answer: 2
    choices_en:
      - "They are always tired"
      - "Their muscles are weak"
      - "Low metabolism saves energy"
      - "They move slowly to hide"
    difficulty: medium
    explanations_en:
      - "Wrong. Sloths aren't tired - they're energy-efficient. Their slow movement is an evolutionary adaptation, not fatigue."
      - "Wrong. Sloth muscles work fine, just differently. They have less muscle mass to save energy, but what they have works well."
      - "Correct! Sloths have incredibly slow metabolism (40-45% slower than expected). This means they need very little food, but also means they move slowly to conserve energy. It's a survival strategy!"
      - "Wrong. While slow movement helps avoid predators, the primary reason is energy conservation due to low metabolism."

  # What happens:
  # ✅ Claude fact-checks your explanations
  # ✅ Claude auto-corrects if needed
  # ✅ DeepSeek translates everything to Chinese
  # ✅ Timestamps added

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - question_en: Max 45 characters

# WORKFLOW:
# 1. Copy this template: cp questions/drafts/template_v2.yaml questions/drafts/my_questions.yaml
# 2. Fill in your questions (just English + choices is enough)
# 3. Run: python scripts/add_questions.py --draft questions/drafts/my_questions.yaml
# 4. Review and commit!
