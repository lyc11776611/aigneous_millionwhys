# Question Draft Template V3 - Claude Code Fact-Checking Workflow
#
# NEW WORKFLOW (V3):
# 1. Create questions in English (you or Claude Code)
# 2. Claude Code fact-checks content HERE in the conversation
# 3. Script translates to Chinese using DeepSeek
# 4. Script adds timestamps automatically
#
# NO ANTHROPIC_API_KEY NEEDED - Fact-checking happens in Claude Code conversation
# ONLY DEEPSEEK_API_KEY NEEDED - For Chinese translation

category: Animals  # Choose from: Animals, Astronomy, Chemistry, Economics, Human Biology, Physics, Plants, Psychology, Technology, Weather, Food & Nutrition, Earth Science

questions:
  # REQUIRED FIELDS (All fact-checked by Claude Code before running script):
  - question_en: "Why do cats have whiskers?"
    correct_answer: 0  # Index 0-3
    choices_en:
      - "To sense surroundings and navigate"
      - "To attract mates"
      - "To keep insects away"
      - "For decoration only"
    explanations_en:
      # IMPORTANT: All 4 explanations must be provided and fact-checked
      # by Claude Code in the conversation BEFORE running the script
      - "Correct! Cat whiskers (vibrissae) are highly sensitive touch receptors that help cats navigate in the dark, judge distances, and detect changes in their surroundings. They're essential sensory tools."
      - "Wrong. Whiskers are not for attracting mates. They are sensory organs that help cats navigate and sense their environment, not reproductive features."
      - "Wrong. Whiskers don't keep insects away. They are sensitive touch receptors used for navigation and spatial awareness in low-light conditions."
      - "Wrong. Whiskers serve important sensory functions. They help cats navigate, judge distances, and detect changes in air currents around them."
    difficulty: easy  # easy, medium, or hard

  # Example 2: Another question
  - question_en: "Why do dogs wag their tails?"
    correct_answer: 2
    choices_en:
      - "Only when they're happy"
      - "To keep balance while running"
      - "To communicate emotions"
      - "To cool down their body"
    explanations_en:
      - "Wrong. Tail wagging doesn't always mean happiness. Dogs wag their tails for various emotions including excitement, anxiety, and even aggression. The speed, height, and direction matter."
      - "Wrong. While tails can help with balance, that's not why dogs wag them. Wagging is specifically for communication with other dogs and humans."
      - "Correct! Dogs wag their tails to communicate a range of emotions and intentions. A high, fast wag might signal excitement, while a low, slow wag could indicate uncertainty. The direction of the wag can even convey different feelings!"
      - "Wrong. Dogs cool down by panting through their mouths, not by wagging their tails. Tail wagging is a form of emotional communication."

# WORKFLOW STEPS:
#
# 1. CREATE QUESTIONS:
#    - You write English questions OR
#    - Ask Claude Code to create them for you
#
# 2. FACT-CHECK WITH CLAUDE CODE:
#    - Claude Code reviews all content in the conversation
#    - Claude Code corrects any inaccuracies
#    - Claude Code ensures scientific accuracy
#    - This happens BEFORE running the script
#
# 3. RUN SCRIPT:
#    - Copy this template: cp questions/drafts/template_v3.yaml questions/drafts/my_questions.yaml
#    - Fill in fact-checked content
#    - Run: python scripts/add_questions.py --draft questions/drafts/my_questions.yaml
#
# 4. SCRIPT AUTOMATICALLY:
#    ✅ Translates to Chinese (DeepSeek)
#    ✅ Adds timestamps (created_at, last_modified_at)
#    ✅ Validates format
#    ✅ Adds to JSON file
#    ✅ Updates master list
#    ✅ NO confirmations needed!

# CHARACTER LIMITS:
# - question_en: Max 45 characters
# - question_zh: Max 25 characters (auto-translated)
# - choices_en: Max 35 characters each
# - choices_zh: Max 15 characters each (auto-translated)
# - Always provide exactly 4 choices
# - Always provide exactly 4 explanations
# - correct_answer is 0-indexed (0, 1, 2, or 3)
# - difficulty: easy, medium, or hard

# IMPORTANT:
# ✅ English explanations are REQUIRED (fact-checked by Claude Code)
# ✅ Chinese translation is AUTOMATIC (DeepSeek)
# ✅ Timestamps are AUTOMATIC
# ✅ No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY needed
# ✅ Only DEEPSEEK_API_KEY needed for translation
# ✅ Fully automated - no confirmations

# EXAMPLE CONVERSATION WITH CLAUDE CODE:
#
# User: "I want to create a question about why the sky is blue"
#
# Claude Code: "Great! Here's a fact-checked question:
#
# Question: Why is the sky blue?
# Correct Answer: Rayleigh scattering
# Choices:
#   0. "Rayleigh scattering of sunlight"
#   1. "Ocean reflects its color"
#   2. "Blue nitrogen in atmosphere"
#   3. "Ozone layer is blue"
#
# Explanations:
#   0. "Correct! Blue light has shorter wavelength..." [fact-checked]
#   1. "Wrong. The ocean is blue because..." [fact-checked]
#   2. "Wrong. Nitrogen is colorless..." [fact-checked]
#   3. "Wrong. The ozone layer..." [fact-checked]
#
# This content has been fact-checked. Now add it to a YAML file and run the script!"
